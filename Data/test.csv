I know this kind of topic already exists, but none of the solutions are working for me and since there are updates these things might have changes as well.

I enabled the ""find people nearby"" feature about a month ago to connect with a friend one time.Since then I get unsolicited messages from strangers several times a week (most of the time sexual content or scamming).

After googling I tried the following, without success:

* Deactivate the ""Nearby"" feature in the App
* Deactivate ""Location"" for the App in Android Settings
* Set all Privacy Settings to the most restrictive option, ""Only Contacts"" or ""Nobody"".
* I have no Username, only my mobile number. For my number the privacy setting is, that nobody can see the number and only my contacts can find me by it.
* I am in no public groups and never have been.

I could not find any more options which I could try and don't know what to do. I would really like to use the app but not under that circumstances.

Best regards and ty for your help."

20,"Durov just posted an announcement in which he claims that Apple and Google are doing bad things regarding free spech and in the same post he tells everyone that bot from Russian Politician Alexey Navalny will be banned because it ""violated local laws"". He announced this in midnight when everyone from Navalny's team was sleeping, just 4 minutes before banning the bot.

Here is two points on why I think this is wrong:

1. Smart Vote bot has not been agitating anyone. It has been sending you a name of one particular candidate depending on your adress. There was no agitation materials such as videos or texts on why you should vote for this candidate. In my opinion, this is not agitation. Pavel also said, that he hopes everyone got their recommendations. The only conclusion I can think is that Pavel don't want Telegram violate Russian law. However, as you may know, Telegram was working fine for 2 years (2018-2020) while Rostelekom was trying to block it for violating local laws about messages decryption.
2. Censoring politicians means there is no free speech in messenger. In previous posts, Pavel said, that Telegram did not censor posts about pandemic where people were telling that covid was creating in lab while other messengers did. While I think it's better to allow free spech on your platform, I find it absolutely impossible to call Telegram a messenger with free speech allowed after they censored Smart Vote bot. Telegram allows free speech, but as soon as Google Play threatened that they will remove Telegram, developer team quckly blocked access to some channels in Play Market version. Telegram allows free speech, but as soon as someone in Kremlin called them and said Telegram is violating local laws, they banned the bot.

Unfortunately there is no worthy alternatives to Telegram and I think there cannot be theoretically better messengers than telegram because Durov is too rich and powerful. I don't expect any better messengers in a few years, but I expect Telegram to start censor more and more stuff. Just 2 years ago they were not removing pirate content and fake news. Now they are censoring politics.

I hope Telegram unban Smart Vote bot soon.

&#x200B;

Edit: I just discovered that they didn't actually banned it! You can still access it via Telegram Bot API:

[It says \\""We couldn't find your region. Please type it again\\"" instead of \\""This bot can?t be displayed because it violated local laws\\""](https://preview.redd.it/n68rs8bps7o71.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=e11bb4b340c90dbda1f10d50b37efb4f112dbde8)

There is only two options here: 

1. They send violation text from their API only to Russians or only through telegram internal messages protocol, but not Bot API. 
2. Or, most likely, they simply mask everything bot sends to you inside Telegram client, not on server. So you can still access it if you want! PM me and I tell you more on how to use bot api and get recommendations (but you can far more easily find google spreadsheet w"

No, your local chats/messages/pictures are nothing more than a cache that you can delete at all time and recover later. This is how you can have true multi-device without a master device, and can have the app on a device without the same phone number in the SIM card.  


If you wish you can export all your messages (to HTML or JSON) with the desktop app. But you can't re-import them later.  You can't revert back to a previous state (like recover deleted mesasges/chats). The ""definitive"" version is the server's one, and your device merely reflect that. Changing your local folders won't impact that.  


If you *really* want to get a hold of the local cache, I know the media (and maybe the messages) are in `Android/data/org.telegram.messenger` (and for direct download version, `org.telegram.messenger.web`).  But again, it's pointless to export/backup those."

We should take it out of the sidebar, since, it doesn't go anywhere anymore. Also, I think a few of those subs are no longer active, and there are a couple new adult ones.

Also, someone should make a new sub for Telegram channels, but actually moderate it. Have a karma limit so people who only post bad links and get downvoted can no longer post. Require accounts to be a few months old so they have to buy new ones (which seemed to be what they were doing). And ban anyone who posts links to channels offering to sell CSAM, or requires you to spam their link to gain access, or other BS. Also, limit channels to only being posted once a week or so.

Having an active channel directory makes Telegram more attractive to new users, but it's equally or perhaps more important to actually maintain it. /r/TelegramChannels was a shit show, and wasn't moderated at all. Lastly, I'm not willing to do it, only because I dump my account regularly and make a new one for privacy purposes.

I have uploaded a movie mp4 file on a private channel. The original file is around 600mb. After the upload, the uploaded file is around 180mb. I did upload it as a file and also tried to upload through drag n drop and chose no compression. Same results. This is happening on the desktop client, didn't try it on my phone. 

Is this compression the default for uploading videos?

79,"Your chat is synchronized in your telegram personal cloud, so deleting cache won't anyway gets near by it. Secondly, i recommend you to use a good cache cleaner, after you're done and cleared everything, don't keep making same routine by deleting manually your memory files in telegram while you can schedule the operation automatically."
80,"I want to start out by saying that we don't know anything for certain, since we don't have the server-side code to check these things. It is entirely possible that nothing every gets deleted... however:

Speaking as a person who dabbled in IT for close to a decade, I would have to guess that keeping everything indefinitely would be astronomically expensive with no real benefits. I would be VERY surprised if that is how it worked - Durovs would literally be hemorrhaging money (more so than they already do? LOL).

My guess is that Telegram keeps track of what files are referenced by ""active"" chats/groups/channels - as in: it has at least one active account associated with it. In such a case, they would keep the file around, as there is a chance that it will be requested. However, if nothing refers to it, I would have to guess that the file gets deleted from the servers.

I think this, because I remember them said something about how Telegram compares files (probably their hash value) that have been uploaded with the ones already in the server, so that if there's already a copy in the server, it just uses that instead. (This was from early days of Telegram - I think they were talking about how they improved file transfer speeds. Can anyone back this up?). You can kind of see this at play if you try to upload the same file twice - the second one ""uploads"" instantly because it is not really uploading. They would only be able to do this if they referenced the files from the chat, instead of having separate copies of the files residing with each chat.

So... TLDR: Most likely scenario is that

* files aren't deleted if there's still someone left to see it.
* But if EVERYONE who could see the file either deleted the chat or deleted their accounts, then it would be deleted.
* However, if the file had been forwarded around, then the original participants deleting the chat/account from their end wouldn't guarantee the file getting deleted."

91,"I found out that today gif has become a synonym for short loopable videos. It's not necessarily the file format from the 90s. Today ""gifs"" are usually mp4 files. It makes sense since the old file format has its limits.

So telegram client stores ""gifs"" as mp4 files. But when I have created my loopable mp4, encoded it with optimal settings (takes only 300kB space) and then upload with Telegram Android and tap the mute button while doing so, Telegram re-encodes it and the video looks like poopoo.

92,"Id be medium tech savvy with stuff like this. 

So I have two telegram accounts on the one phone.

Each have a different phone number which I used and am still in possession of.

Last night my phone beeped and there was an alert from telegram sayin 2 step security had been set up and also a telegram login code. 

I looked and said wtf.

Went into said account that I too was still logged into.

My name was changed and I had joined some Russian stocks group or something like that.

I logged out the other session.
I logged out of my desktop session.

I clicked change password but I didnt know the password the hacker set up.
I clicked disable password and it said ive to wait 6 more days.

Here is where it gets more crazy, the hackers login was from the same country as me (well not saying it actually was but it showed an ip from same country) my old phone and model and exact android number showed up on this login.

This exact phone is at home, turned off and not in use.

So they somehow had this information too. Freaky!

I have screen shots of most of this.

The account is logged still and Im hoping nothing else happens.

Can anyone shed some light on it???

Probably people were asking telegram to be able to be able to have background music for their messages. It was impossible before, now they can do it. If you don't want background audio, you can do it too, just pause it. It's usually only a swipe away on the notification shade."

107,"heya r/telegram ?. just putzing this morning. the leisurely topic at hand is as follows:

a post of mine was deleted by a moderator. i am most definitely not complaining, or trying to lure attention to a perceived injustice, or trying to rock the vessel. nothing here but immaculate lighthearted curiosity. a quest for knowledge to light my way forward. i'm new to social media.

here is the post: *Hi* [*r/Telegram*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/)*. I apologize if I'm asking about a topic that has been beaten beyond submission, or if I'm posting this in the wrong place. Social media was already scary before I was scolded severely for asking a question on a website called Bookface or whatever. Now it terrifies me. I am, however, insatiably curious about the lack of a certain feature in Telegram that has been standard for many years in those software applications which accept keyboard input, so I have buried my fear in order to make this query. Please don't berate me for my lack of Reddit experience.*

*I'm a new Telegram user, and have not found a way to have the MacOS version of this messaging app underline misspelled words in red as I type. Seems to be working fine on my phone. What gives?*

My only theory is that it was repealed by way of the regulation that informs we should refrain from queries relating to technical support, but the caveat states this applies to issues affecting few users, whereas my issue appears to be relatively widespread. 

Or perhaps the topic was pummeled to dirt over too many discussions, and I'm just late to the cookout? As mentioned previously, this is simple curiosity in its purest amalgamation, and part of my crash course in reddit moderation for the sake of post retention.

Bots aren't able to stop a persons telegram notifications, so if someone is the sort of dolt that leaves their volume on full blast then gets annoyed because of a message at 3am then they are only going to be even more annoyed when they check their phone only to discover the message that woke them up was deleted by a bot."

123,"Hey. So Im basically trying to manage my Telegram messaging and backups so that I dont end up with 3 duplicate photos or videos each time someone sends me something. Ok, here goes my issue, let me know if I am wrong in something

So, as far as I know, if you have auto downloads enabled, each time someone sends you a video/image it gets downloaded in a Telegram folder, either on your phone or desktop right? Now my question is, whats the purpose of manually clicking on download when having autodownload? Im guessing its either just for chosing another path to download the file or maybe it doesnt get as compressed by downloading it this way?

Now considering I turn off auto downloads, each time someone sends me a file I have to click on it to download it, im guessing once I do that it downloads in the same folder as the autodownloads? Now I like this because I just have to download a file once for backing it up, instead of having my phone sync the whole media of a chat even If I have it already backed up, so that I chose what to download each time. Thing is, doesnt this get clunky when someone sends a bunch of files (like a lot of pictures)? Do I have to be clicking them all one by one?"
124,"So I've always had problems with Telegram when it comes to uploading and downloading files. Most of the time, the upload/download won't finish, it suddenly stops and I have to start it again from scratch. For instance, I'm trying to download a file (quite a big one, 1.9GB), and I have managed to download 1.1GB of it, but then the download stops and I have to restart. This is happening both in the app and on desktop, there doesn't seem to be a pattern, for instance, the last time I tried downloading the file, it went up to 300MB and then reset. I tried using download manager bots but they limit the download speed harshly, I'm downloading the file right now using a bot and it will take about 3 hours, while downloading directly from Telegram would take an hour. So I'd like to know if somebody has this issue and if they have found a solution. So far, I have tried: different browsers, updated the app, restarted my internet modem, tried with desktop, tried with VPN, nothing has worked so far.

To fix this problem i have to: Settings>Data & Storage>Storage Usage>Clear Telegram Cache, but as soon as I open a new chat, those first 3 exact file respawn from nowhere (i guess them are gifs), and shows up again in the gallery as the first screenshot.

I do not prefer to be followed BTW, I'm happy to connect ;)"
153,"Hi there, 

Have you mentioned RoR in the skills section? If they have used LinkedIn Recruiter it would catch it as a keyword. Sometimes as recruiters we go purely for the skills mentioned which is not always the best decision but if the role is hard to fill you try every option. 

I would suggest that you mention it in your summary. I think every decent recruiter would respect that and not message you about such roles."
154,"Hi all, previously one of the biggest reasons I used Premium was for connecting with entrepreneurs and job candidates. Unlimited searches and high connection limits made it a very powerful tool.

Coming back to LI after a couple of years of not needing to network, I've noticed the ""100 per week"" invitation limit. If I pay for Premium, or Sales Navigator etc, do the limits go away?

If not, it seems like outreach through connection requests is more or less finished. What's the best way to continue networking?"
155," I'm working for an events company and I market through Linkedin on both the CEO's personal page (he has over 3,000 followers) and his company page.

Is it possible to advertise just off his personal page to his connections even though it's just a personal page?"
156,"Check points like these before applying:
1) Quick google search to find if the company is legit or not
2) Make sure the company has some followers on the LinkedIn page
3) Check if they have some employee (even founder / owner) works fine
4) check the employee's LinkedIn and google the person as well to see if something is coming or not
5) Company has a website? 

These things help to validate if a company is genuine or not, I hope that helps"

I want to get my VA to work on repurposing posts for LinkedIn but I want to get the character count right too. 1300 always seemed like a low number so I'm glad they raised it (if that's indeed what happened) but I don't want to have them do a bunch of work only to have to make them go back and lower the word count all over again.

167,"Every linkedin subscription comes with limited number of inmails each month. 

Inmails let you message anyone without connection with certain limitations.

If you accept and reply to an inmail the sender gets another inmail free. If you reject the inmail the sender also gets another inmail free. If you do nothing the inmail is never given back.

So in a way ignoring an inmail ""costs"" the sender."
168,"You've got a few ways to approach this, which you've already thought of. If it's significant enough, I would add it as a separate role. Or you can add it to your current role per how you've written it at the end of your post. It really depends on how you yourself feel about it and how much you want it to stand out in terms of future career opportunities. If it's a separate listing, a recruiter may ask why, but you can explain easily enough. If it's part of the current job listing, it might look a bit too wordy and risk not being read in its entirely.

Their help team will be able to answer that definitively for you"
171,"To answer your questions, 

1. No, there is no auto notification feature
2. No, unless you start to add former colleagues yourself, then the AI will start to link you to 2nd or 3rd degree suggestions

4. The privacy settings are not that granular, you can hide your full name, you can prevent your profile appearing in Google searches, and you can prevent members from outside your 1st degree connections from adding you."
172,"Yes. Do it.

Far too many people have connections that they don't actually know. This kills LinkedIn as a tool.  It is utterly worthless to have a connection you don't actually know, to be able to arrange a connection for a friend or have any impact with your recommendations.

175,"Hi guys!

I have a question. One of my team members is admin of all our company pages and showcases from their personal LinkedIn account. We have to use their LinkedIn to process requests that come in to the team. 

It has become quite an issue, not least because it's being managed from one person's profile and it's leading to them getting dozens of admin requests every week. 

Is there a workaround here? We used to have a fake LinkedIn profile and we just used that, but LinkedIn recently cracked down on this and it goes against account terms. 

Any management apps, services etc. that are either free or paid? Budget isn't really an issue, so if this can be offered as part of a wider integration then we'd definitely look at it. 

Any advice? Tbh, I don't think there's any alternatives but thought it was worth a shot!

Thanks!"

Despite emailing my concerns with the customer support on how I could resolve the issues (*I want to make sure this incident does not happen again*), they proposed on ""**(checking) whether your computer or phone has any software that collects information from multiple social or networking websites for display in a single application**"".

As far I am concerned, I hadn't viewed any of the profiles since past weeks as I was busy preparing for examinations, and only recently (about a week ago), after I changed my PC, I realized I have to manually log-in to the site both on my mobile devices and web browser; in the past, I have always been able to log-in automatically without any CAPTCHA.

Though, my account was temporarily restricted for 1 day, the issue is still not resolved; there might still be an underlying software, or malware, that might consequently get my account flagged in the future.

**Did anyone experience such issue as well, and how do you go ahead about resolving it? Any advice or experiences will be appreciated greatly.**

I am currently using Google Chrome as my primary web browser, and have just ran an anti-virus/malware to clear my system - no issues.

180,"Hi.
(So I don't have LinkedIn so you know)
I was looking for a private teacher for september and I saw one on famous website of my country, so I decided to copy and paste his name on Google to see if there's something ab him (random stalking) and the third link on Google was his LinkedIn account so I clicked on it to see his diplomas (remember, I don't have an account so I'm not connected at all) and then there's the ""people also viewed"" Box and they were like 4 people I know on it (we were in the same school 6/7y ago) + other people I dont know but my question is how why TF did they suggest me 4 people I know  From the same school? Like all in once? 
The private teacher guy wasn't even in this school so no link between them also. 
I don't even have their phone number or don't have them on social media neither.
Is this normal? I don't believe this is just some coincidence/hazard so I'm wondering how do they know this"
181,"You're not wrong.  What I find interesting is how every single person in those threads who even benignly mentions that's it's not appropriate for Linkedin, get the most amount of replies--nearly all of which quickly turn into charged personal attacks.

186,"Based on my question I?m pretty sure the answer would be no however to go a little more in-depth. 


1st question:
I want to get in contact with a few people however when I click on their profile, it says I don?t have access to viewing it, I?m guessing their profile is only viewable to their connections. 

Issue is, I?ll never be able to connect with that person if their profile isn?t accessible. Is there a way to view their profile or maybe figure out a way to see if they?ve commented on a post where I could then tap on their profile? (Though I?m not sure if that?s viable)


2nd question:
Following up, I tried looking up a group of people who works for a specific company, wanted to network with a few of either or both current and ex employees to ask some questions. The company, as well as the current workers shows up, but it only shows their job title, it doesn?t give their name so I can?t search them up on another social media site to attempt to contact them. 

This is basically the same question I suppose as above really but somewhat different circumstances. 

Thanks for the help."
187,"I've had a similar issue when searching jobs, where I wanted certain titles excluded.  I'm in IT, and many of them are only loosely labelled as ""IT""

Try using the NOT statement in your search.  If you want to exclude jobs in the USA, try ""NOT USA""

Sadly, LI does not provide a way to remove sponsored posts.  I don't have Premium, so I can't say whether or not it makes a difference."
188,"My view is different- use it and do not worry about what the company may or may not do.

In the unlikely event your employer notices and presses you on it. your answer is easy - I value my career and as a matter of family policy always keep an eye on the market and opportunities.

You own your career, no one else, do not let anyone hold you back from doing what is right for you and yours."

After this discovery, I switched to anonymous, but for all I know I?m worried that they?ll find out I was looking at their profile repeatedly out of boredom (found it when googling them), and I?ll have to explain why. 

PS: This is a person that I kind of have a crush on, but I highly doubt I?ll ever be dating them due to lots of factors, but we?ve always had a nice relationship as friends/acquaintances. I?m really hoping that they don?t know I?ve been ?creeping? their profile, and then they won?t like me anymore.

Question is: I don?t want people who worked with me in that company to easily find me. 

1. Will they be auto notified if I add the company?
2. Will they see me in suggestions list all of the sudden?
3. Will the person running the company page get notified? If so can I find out first who runs it?
4. Is there any privacy setting I may change to prevent 1-3? For example I think some setting can prevent people from seeing me as a previous employee in the search if they are to search for previous employees of that company"
204,"Hey guys

So, I know linkedin has a profile search limit for regular accounts up to 100 pages or 1000 profiles, but I couldn't find information if this applies for searching posts or hashtags. Does anyone know will the 100 pages limit be there if I search for #bitcoin for example?"
205,"Welcome to LinkedIn! There are specific sections that you can add achievements and awards to. If your profile is set to notify your connections when you make updates, these will show in your news feed. If you're looking to do these as posts, however, people will see that you posted these recently, even if written in past tense. I always recommend being judicious about what you post (Career Coach here). If it's something really interesting, make it a post. If it's a chain of posts about past achievements, you might lose people's interest quickly. 

Work challenges can go in your work experience section under the relevant job if these turned out to be accomplishments. If they're challenges that you can turn into some unique learning insights, a post can be useful (so long as it's truly beneficial and applicable to readers).

Good luck and best wishes :-)"

However, 50,000 views of a personal post didn't translate into leads.  e.g.  I didn't get any more website visitors.  In contrast, my professional posts generates leads, especially video.  For full disclosure, I'm UK video production.

So yes, it's becoming more like FB in that there's a ton more personal stuff being posted on there but the stuff that's really making a difference is the professional posts.  That's what's generating me leads.  So personal posts for the reach, professional to get the leads."

* Women going ""OMG the 10th person this week DM'ed me asking me to meet up. I am soooo sick of all this attention I get which I never ask for by posting about it on LinkedIn. This place is supposed to be for professionals"". 1000 likes....
* Just general wanking ""A good leader answers the questions Google can't"". GTFO! And when that's got 10k + reactions... wtf

That being said, LinkedIn can still be a very valuable tool.  I have a blog with free tips and tricks which is updated regularly which might help.

215,"I'd suggest pretty the same: don't wait for others will reach you, apply for the jobs which you're interested in. And it's also depending on the kind of job you're looking for? If you'd prefer to work in startups for example. LinkedIn isn't the best place for that. Try Angellist, YC job portal, etc."
216,"Hey,

I was looking at a job posting of \[company A\]. In my message view, the message ""connection to \[company A\]"" appeared and a contact of mine was suggested. Was does this exactly mean, how is this calculated? My contact has never worked there. I scanned his connections and he has a contact of one of the board members in his connections. Is this the reason for that?"
217,"I've had many recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn when I wasn't even looking for a new job. It helps if you really fill out your profile so it'll come up when they search for the right keywords.

Otherwise, I've found that LinkedIn is a great way to keep track of old colleagues after you've moved on to another job. It's pretty awesome being able to see what your co-worker from 15 years ago is currently doing, even though you haven't spoken in that long. And it could absolutely lead to something else in the future."
218,"I am not a fan of social media and I had created a LinkedIn account when it was new and also had quite a few connections. However I got bored very soon and deleted it after sometime. Recently, I applied for a job at Linkedin for Customer Support and I didn't really think I would even be considered but I got a call the very next day and my interview got scheduled. Now, will it hurt my chances if I don't use LinkedIn myself? And how do I answer it if the recruiter asks me the same? Also my interview is in a few days so I did create a new account and all, but I'm very short on time to make new connections and all. Thank you for your help."
219,I'd like to send people a remainder to respond to my messages without the need to send a new message. I know there are automated reminders but I think I'd like to control when and how frequent the reminders are.

221,I once unfollowed a colleague and  I just refollowed him. He must have been notified as I discovered he has blocked me. This is awkward he must be upset that I unfollowed him. hope linkedin can remove the notification of a re-follow. anyone from MSFT/Linkedin here taking this suggestion.

I would make sure it wasn't even listed because that would make people know you had to go to remedial work.  The general rule would be only do things after high school anyway.  Best of luck."
224,"Spam.

Marketing nonsense. Frankly, spending days marketing myself sounds like the worst job in the world. Reposting junk from everyone else's LinkedIn... what is this? Instagram? Making your own content... even more exhausting.

I will grant - this is exactly what LinkedIn has turned into. Not a networking platform, a marketing platform."

226,"I have been speaking to a few of my connections on LinkedIn and they praised what LinkedIn meant to them in terms of building connections and generating organic leads through outbound prospecting.    


But they looked hesitant when asked to start LinkedIn ads for lead generation. They find it as a costlier channel for advertising.    


Why LinkedIn ads are premium?"
227,"I'm a introvert freelance ui/ux designer, i need work but in order to get it, i have to talk and try to sell myself. I thought i should ask people like me, who are in this field ( ui/ux ). So i logged in to linkedin but to explain these whole thing and convince them to help me out, is something i haven't done, so i don't really know what to write.

 i tried google but it was all bullshit ( be clear, transparent and personalize), i get that at core these will make sense, i don't even understand what it means to be transparent or personalize. Some samples might work but i have no idea.

so it will be very helpful if anyone know what to write or how to write, to get some connections."
228,"Next time people you are unsure want to connect with you, ignore their request and also say you do not know them when given that option.  This way, if those people get enough ""I Don't Knows"", they will be permanently banned from LinkedIn."
229,"So I started a linkedin premium trial about a week ago, and the only jobs it ever shows me for the ""jobs where you're a top applicant"" section are jobs in random cities I don't want to work in, and they're not even remote jobs. I either want a remote job or one in my area. I have my city on my profile and I have the commute preferences set to my area. Is there not a way to customize what kinds of jobs it shows you in the top applicant section?

I don't think it's because there's not enough results for me, because when I manually look through jobs I sometimes see the top applicant badge on jobs in my area."
230,"Hi, 

I'm currently a student in my last year of high school. I finished my education in Kumon long back. I attained the highest honour there is to be given in Kumon In mathematics. I feel Kumon certifications are not worthy of being on LinkedIn. 

According to you guys, should Kumon certifications be on my LinkedIn. That too, achieving the highest honour and not just passing some level. 

Do let me know your views and if you're not sure what Kumon is, you can google it and easily find the information.

Thanks!"
231,"Hello. I want to ask you for advice.

For 12 months I was working for company A. I didn't want to switch jobs for at least a 6 or 8 additional months because I don't think people would like to hire a person who is switching jobs every year.

Thing is, my company A was bought by company B, and on top of that, this company B doesn't have a branch in my country so they ordered company C to hire me and they will be ""outsourcing"" me.

And I have no idea how to present this on both my Linkedin profile and my CV. My main concern is that recruiters will see this as I am jumping jobs every year or so and it will lower my chances of scoring a nice job.

I kinda know how to play it in my CV, I will simply put a description under experience tab that my company was bought by B and I was working in C starting from there. So I think that potential employees will see that it wasn't my bad, but maybe it was even a plus that my company was bought and I wasn't fired but transferred :D

Thing is, I have no idea how to play it well in Linkedin. As far as I know I don't have any option to put a comment in my work history? (I am other than my ""wall"" but I don't like this idea) So for the outsiders it will look like that:

 \- Company A - 12 months

\- Company C - (let's say 6 months)

And my problem is, that first, those 12 months looks kinda short already, but if I let's say will want to switch jobs in another 6 months (so total of 1.5 year) it will look for recruiters that I changed my job AGAIN after 6 months and it will definitely look suspicious.

What do you think? How should I play it out so recruiters will still consider me as a good addition to their companies?"
232,"I took a bunch of short courses from IBM's CognitiveClass.ai (previously called Big Data University). They recommended adding the completed courses to LinkedIn's Licenses & Certifications section, so that's what I did. 

The Licenses & Certification section has specific fields for Credential ID and Credential URL. The Education section does not.

CognitiveClass.ai courses are ranked as Level 1 (basic) and Level 2 (intermediate). Once my list started getting long, I removed all the Level 1 courses.

I recommend only listing courses/certs that would be of highest value to potential employers.

There is a trade-off between SEO and human readability. The more courses you list, the more likely your profile will contain key words that help you appear in recruiters' search results, but the less likely a recruiter or HR person will read your list of courses. Asking yourself the question, ""How much will employers care about this course/cert?"" will hopefully help you strike a good balance between SEO and human readability."
233,"I was really young when I got access to the internet, which meant that I made an account almost everywhere. Now that it is time to set up an linkedin for real my account has been restricted (I put a really dumb name). Is there anyway to delete this account?"
234,"Recruiter here.

Put them in the certificates tab as usually, when we use LI Recruiter, we use keywords and this covers also the certificate tab. For example, if I put TS410 as a keyword it shows me all the people that got a certificate in that exam."
235,"It took me a lot of time to find a specific contact I needed. I clicked the send invitation button and the website suggested that I should send it with a message. I chose to go with a message but then realized that I should polish it first. So I canceled to write a message and closed the popup to send an invitation (where you choose with or without message). I wrote the text in Word and was about to click the send invitation button - it's no longer there. My invitation was sent without any message.

Any advice on what should I do? I really need to contact the person but the case seems bad, and LinkedIn appears to be the only way for contacting,

\-- Update:

I've contacted LinkedIn support. In short, this is how the system works, I cannot add a message after invitation, I cannot cancel the invitation without a 3-week penalty, my suggestions were passed to developers."
236,"have about 5,000 connections, yet only 4-10 people interact on the posts i make.

linkedin thinks the posts aren't good, so they don't show it to more people.

the analytics show that the post was viewed by maybe 100-300 people, but i don't believe that number one bit.

i kind of feel like disconnecting from everyone who is connected but doesn't follow me, and people who aren't interacting with me or my business proposals.

nothing personal, i just want my business to succeed, and the inactivity of my connections is really killing my reach.

i thought about doing one of those engagement traps where people post things like ""double tap to see magick"", or ""press like to work from home, press celebrate to work from office"", but that would be unprofessional, and will  drive off people i do want to do business with.

i'm not sure what to do."

Thanks in advance"
240,"1. You are right not to lie on LI, or anywhere else for that matter.

2. There is no need to share details you don't want to share, unless you're specifically asked about them during an interview. 

3. The purpose of LinkedIn is to improve your future, not to meticulously document your past. Employment gaps are more visible if they are between jobs. If you only mention your current job and the promotion, but not the previous jobs, it will give the impression that you simply couldn't be bothered to go back any further.

4. At 22-24 it is fine to experiment a little. Some people go backpacking for a year to explore other parts of the world without intending to settle there. And some folks work low-wage jobs to explore other parts of the labor market, also without intending to stay there forever, but to figure out what industry they want to work in and where to steer their career. Both groups are looking for orientation and new experiences at the beginning of their adult life, and I don't find either route better or worse than the other. I'm sure that, if questioned, you can sell your past in a more appealing and relatable way than you did by simply referring to it as shitty minimum wage retail jobs :)"
241,"I hope you enjoyed my witty thread title.

I spent the weekend in the sun updating my LinkedIn profile with 10 years worth of career content. I?m pretty happy with what I?ve done but I?m looking for some honest  critique / feedback on what else I can do to improve. I find it hard reviewing my own profile content, and I don?t know anyone personally that would be willing to review what I?ve written and give useful input, so I?m reaching out to good ol? Reddit for help. 

My current position is that I?m wanting to build up my company and build connections organically, but I still need a job to fund my own life expenses. With this in mind, I?m looking for a perm role (preferably remote) in the world of Software / Web Development as my current role is coming to an end since Covid is dying down. I?m under 30 years of age, and never had the opportunity to become accredited in a certain skill but do have a few years of experience in Lead/Senior roles. As far as I see things, the only way I can ?impress? potential employers is by showcasing the skills I?m self taught in,  and showcase what I?ve built. I?m very entrepreneurial and am determined to build a team and run a successful business in the I.T field. I?ve done this before but never earned quite enough money to get by and keep drifting back to employed positions. Im determined that it?s still possible, so not giving up!

So yeah, here?s my profile:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeljmurphy

If you see gaps it?s because I?ve either been travelling or been working freelance. I wasn?t sure how beneficial it was to list freelance work multiple times between my employed positions? Other than that, the number of connections I have is quite low so I am thinking of engaging with posts a lot  more to gain connections. Anything else obvious standing out? Thank you in advance."

244,"Hiring managers are less likely to use email notifications, as those are most useful to people who use LinkedIn infrequently. Hiring managers tend to be on LinkedIn often enough to get direct notifications (web or app) and email would only add unnecessary noise."
245,Should I use a resume that will be easier to run a keyword search on or the more stylish looking resume. Content on both is the same. But I've been told it's easier to run a search on a one column resume vs two columns
246,"If anyone who works at Linkedin reads this board, I would highly recommend updating the filter section to allow people to filter OUT companies rather than in. Certain companies abuse the board and post hundred's of job ads for every city in America with the remote work, and I don't have anyway to filter it out."
247,"Why not?  My concern though, is that you would be flagged as violating TOS agreement.

The way linkedin works, they know exactly who you are by who you are linked to as well as various shared information with other evil trillion dollar companies."
248,"op, i am in similar situation as yours i would like to create multiple accs,but even though you resolved the ip issue what about browser fingerprints i would like to get more , information on how to fo it,i think creating a different browsing environment is true solution i was looking for some information about this online ,but there are few available,op if you can give more info on this it would be helpful"
249,"So I was recently hired  by an organization that offers free Linkedin premuims. A couple weeks ago through automated payment, I paid for two total months of linkedin premuim and I wanted to cancel it but I couldn't be bothered since I was enjoying my vacation and it's impossible to get a hold of linkedin

So after coming back from vacation, I thought to myself I needed to at least cancel the subscription the services so that it stops after the billing period ends. What happened is that it actually cancelled my premuim service. I don't have access yet to my work's free premuim benefit, but I was shocked that It cancelled my premuim. 

I thought it was going to at least keep the account for two more months since I paid a week ago for two months.

crazy how they have no way of being contacted! The most unproffesional way of providing service."
250,"It's not all about qualification and fancy jobs.

But if you have some kind of experience,then you can show there.
And through that you can build your network.

You may be doing job or having a business....Ultimately LinkedIn is really awesome to give a try.??"
251,"I'm a recruiter of software people. Have been more than ten years. You've probably heard the system is broken let me tell you how from the inside:

1. I got a requisition to hire four software devs for a large financial software client. That took 700 connections and I almost didn't make it. Of those 700, I interviewed maybe 70  (@ 20 minutes each) who answered me. (I get fired if you don't meet my quota)
2. The ones I did pass to the next round get interviewed. If the interviewers like the person they demand I get the candidate immediately for the next interview. If they don't maybe they tell me - maybe they don't.
3. I have may 10 other jobs to work on besides this one. Again, if I don't make quota for hires I get fired. 

But how do you use this info?  

Use recruiters like they use you. You can be a sales genius but numbers rule. Reach as many as you can. Don't let a day go by without some activity.  

But be smart. Most jobs have about 3 must-haves. Make sure the top of your resume says in clear terms you have those three things. ie: ""You request five plus years Java - I have 10""

DO follow up and make it easy for me. Attach your resume or link me to Linkedin, link the job post. And say something like - ""Hi, I applied last week to this. If you think I'm fit I'm available (blocks of time) for a chat. Let me know""

Here's something no one talks about: How much do you want? Go high but don't be crazy. Do your research. Play with the ask until you seem to get a good response.

Don't wait for an answer. Move on. As the mob says, ""It ain't personal it's business""

System is broken and ego plays a big role. What CEO wants to admit they have to pay for ... um ... candidates. I need you and you need me but this is not the platform for long term friendships no matter what you see on the career landing page. It's just business."
252,"I'm trying to apply to a bunch of jobs, and I typically keep job postings that I have already applied to until I either hear back from them or like 3 weeks+ have passed.

VERY VERY VERY OFTEN, when I go back to these tabs that have been sitting around for like 6+ days to double check if I have already applied to the position already, and my browser auto refreshes the page it just ends with a black screen any nothing loads. This then causes a chain reaction where ALL INTERACTION with LinkedIn ceases to work, all pages I try to go to (other previous tabs/the brand new job postings I just opened/the main linkedIn page) everything stops working and all I get are black screens no matter what url i use and how many times I refresh the page.

This usually takes 5-10 minutes for it to fix itself? or something where I can then refresh the pages again and it restores the actual page. However this doesn't actually solve the problem as when I try to re-load the older tabs as well as the newer tabs, halfway through fixing the black screens, the latter half of the tabs I choose to refresh end up crashing again."
253,"I have set up an event page on LinkedIn for my company but the banner (no matter what image I use) augments (stretches or cuts the middle section) on the mobile version. I don't understand how this could be. I've tried different image sizes, file types etc. And nothing works"
254,"Standard industry practice really. Read an article recently about the growing tendency of companies striving to find THE perfect candidate. It's becoming increasingly popular to try and find someone you can throw into the fray from day one, as opposed to a candidate you train and grow organically.

This results in positions staying open for months, which in turn cheap management sees as the department being oversized, since they can clearly operate without the position, and close it to save on expenses.

What does it have to do with ghosting and you? Recruiters will try to find said perfect candidate as hard as possible, and will often find several good, but not perfect matches along the way. They want to leave that option on the table in case they have to fill the position in a rush, but don't want to commit in case they find someone who perfectly matches the job description."
255,"When you look at the layout of your profile you see your picture, name, and occupation. However, on the right side, it shows your education and your most recent workplace. I would rather not have that work there as it makes it appear as though I'm still working there, which I'm not since I'm looking for a job right now. 

Also, I didn't have the best experience and departure from that company so I rather it not be front and center constantly. Is there a setting somewhere that disables that function or a way to turn it off? If so, please let me know and that would be greatly appreciated!"
256,"I was searching about 200 jobs matching a specific term in my local area and noticed that after about 100 hides (the icon with a slash through it in the search results in the left pane), the feature stopped working.  Jobs I hid showed up in subsequent search results. 

This made the search especially difficult because if I clicked around or tried to fine-tune the results, I was shown a hundred jobs I already indicated I wasn't interested in and had to hide them again which didn't work after another search query.

This feature is extremely important to the site's overall usability for me because of the nature of my experience--I'm in tech and have a lot of experience and do well in a small subset of tools and languages.  However, they're used in many different orgs that aren't relevant to my direct direct line of work.

Once I apply to a job or am disinterested, I no longer want to see it, so it's really important this feature works. I have maybe thousands of jobs to search through so what can I do to actually hide a job for my purposes in the meantime?"
257,"Loo  for the hadhtags you are interested in and start following the authors, comment their posts and after a while you can add them or the people who commented and personalize the invite saying you got interested in their opinions and would like to stay in touch and keep learning from them and their content, also you can add people from the companies you'd like to work for in the future and say you want to stay in touch in case that in the future there's an open position that may fit your profile , You can of course share posts and start the conversations."

270,"Hello everyone!

How's everyone doing in these trying times?

I have a question about listing my job on LinkedIn, what's the best and non-cringy way of doing it in this situation.

I got hired for a good job in a global company on a 2-year contract, and even though almost all the interviews were conducted by the representatives of this global company, I am formally employed by the outside employment agency and delegated to work for that global company. I think it's pretty common, but this is my first time, and I'm not sure what's the proper way of listing it on LinkedIn. Or a resume, for that matter.

Ideally, because why not, I'd love to emphasize doing work for that global company, but I don't wanna lie about actually being their employee. Would something like this make sense:

*Job title* (Global Company via Employment Agency)

That seems pretty accurate but still highlights the important thing. Is this a good way of listing it on LinkedIn and the resume, or is this something recruiters cringe at? I genuinely have no grasp on it yet as this is a brand new situation for me, so I'll take the facts as brutally as needed, as well as any suggestions and recommendations you might have!

Thanks! Cheers!"
271,"I always respond and say thanks for reaching out, I don?t think this would be a good fit but please keep me in mind for other roles. Then I?ll add maybe a short couple lines on my experience and field of interest. I think it?s a good practice to keep those doors open"
272,"Just add a second language to your existing profile and fill it with the appropriate information. Not sure how to do that on the app, but on web there's a button near the top right corner of your profile page."
273,"Dear All, do you know if LinkedIn has a limit to the number of connection invites you can send? I got a warning that ?you are nearing your weekly connection invite limit and you could be stopped from sending invites for a week?. Any body?"
274,"There is not private vs live version of company pages. Everything is published and live from the get go.

I?d recommend creating the page so that you have the desired URL locked in. Last I check, after it has been created, you can edit everything except for the url. 

I?ve worked with a few companies before they launched. And we just kept as much as we could blank. And required fields we just wrote in ?Stealth?. The logo was just a black box. What would go on the page lived in a google doc or word document until you are ready for it to go live. That was you can get it as close as possible to flipping the switch. 

Now, don?t be foolish and try and associate your personal page with the company page by adding it as an experience until after you?ve filled the page with all the accurate information. 

Your personal page is not associated with the company page until you add it as an experience on your profile. Admins for company pages are not visible to the user- so your blank, stealth company will just appear as a place holder company with zero employees, and a unique url."

Normally, their email address is hidden unless we made a LinkedIn connection. I do not want to startle my connection, so is it recommended to ask my connection permission to use their email address in case if I never emailed them?

I really do not want to sound like someone who is overly obsessed or a creep, and I can get very insecure at times."

278,"No matter what my filters are or what fields I plug in, LinkedIn only shows me jobs for fields I?m not in, qualified for, or looking to move into. I can?t find any relevant jobs without wading through hundreds of medical and HR jobs and have no idea how to filter these out."
279,"LinkedIn Learning is basically Lynda.com content that?s been bought and expanded. The subscription is worth it if you plan to take multiple courses, and also it comes with other Premium benefits. They?re all professionally made and edited so you will get a professionally produced course.

Udemy has a larger variety in both quantity and quality of courses, both good and bad. If you?re willing to sort through a lot of fluff and then just buy one course it?s probably cheaper. If you plan to learn a lot, LinkedIn Learning is more valuable the more you use."
280,"I?m curious as to whether you?d put a job/volunteering opportunity start date from when you first did training with the organisation, or the first day you did the actual job?

2 instances:

- training completed at the start of January, first job day in February (agency work)

- training from mid April to mid May, first volunteering shift in May

What dates would you use? Would you consider it different for a job vs volunteering?"
281,"Hi all, I've been having trouble for the past couple weeks loading LinkedIn on my desktop. No matter what I try to view on LinkedIn, it simply loads a grey screen with the logo in the top left corner of the screen. Has anyone else ever had this issue? What can I do to fix it?

For reference, I have already tried disabling extensions, using different browsers, and private browsers. Nothing seems to work."
282,"I don?t have Facebook but every day I get people telling me I?m
Facebook even though I run a big company that I advertise everyday on there?. So personal stuff with a business mix I think is okay ??????? kids stuff like first day of school
Crap is kinda lame.   But then again I just scroll past????"
283,"Hi everyone. So I attended a virtual 3-day tech conference and there were a lot of recruiters, heads of global talent acquisition, etc., for a lot of the big FAANG tech companies, that I noticed came to the event in the long list of attendees.

I know that most people approach recruiters on LinkedIn when they're interested in pursuing a new role, but I'm not at the moment (upcoming Senior in college & have a paid internship for this Summer), but I still of course want them to be in my network on LinkedIn.

**So my question is - how do you effectively approach/network with a recruiter if you don't need a job immediately?**  It seems like most networking advice is geared towards taking action *after* you've lost a job/you're tired of your current one, etc. instead of networking taking action *before* any of this happens.

Is ""Hello, I saw that you attended the same \[tech conference name\] just like I did, let's connect"" lame? Give me some good suggestions on what to say to properly approach this situation.

All responses are appreciated ??"
284,True that. Someone mocked my religion. I mocked their religion in return. And obviously linkedin banned me. Will have to make a new account soon. But won't prevent me from mocking someone's religion if they mock mine. LinkedIn would become like twitter in sometime.
285,"Hello everyone, I wish to know if Linkedin polls actually get sufficient responses in general? I am happy to be wrong but my perception is that Linkedin?s poll still in its beta stage and I do not recall having seen a poll with credible responses and impactful influence. I am happy to be wrong."
286,"Sort-of. I end up seeing a lot of political posts, which is pretty annoying, since I've got a personal policy of avoiding making political statements like the plague on any account that uses my name.

They get pretty annoying, especially since the posts are typically platitudinous or in-your-face in the way that I'd expect for a place like Twitter, not a platform for a bunch of self-described ""professionals"".

When I notice somebody making or sharing those posts, I'll typically sever the LinkedIn connection, and does the trick."
287,"Worth appealing and asking for another review and specify that you are not using any third party/unauthorized browser extensions. Other option is to ask for 'personal data' and rebuild your profile using another email address, your original profile will not be viewable to the wider network or your connections list,"
288,"Not a direct answer to your question, but I believe if you sign up for LinkedIn premium you get LinkedIn learning included. Given both cost $30/mo you might as well go with premium since you get access to premium features as well."
289,"Hello,

I have a 2-years gap because in 2016 I started a CS degree, and in 2018 I transferred to another university. From what I've read online, that can be interpreted as 2 wasted years but at the same time, they advise not to include any unfinished degrees and I also didn't have any job experience nor big portfolio projects to fill that space.

Any advice on how could I confront this problem?

Thanks."
290,"Is there a way for me to filter my LinkedIn search for:

* Only current premium members? I want to do this so I can utilize the free inmails feature
* Only people with > 300 connections? So that I only target people who are most likely to be active on LinkedIn

For reference, I have a recruiter lite account."
291,"Hi sort of new to linkedin, i work at this place now my official title doesn't match what i really do. I've asked my manager and HR to update my title but they can't be bothered. So i wanted to put a senior title on my linkedin profile because it more closely matches what i do and i'm trying to move ahead in my career.

i'm concerned my company's HR and manager will object to me using a title that's not matching what's on my job title.

does the company get notified when you add them to your profile with your role and title or is it private? I don't plan to add any of my colleagues as they are toxic, many thanks"
292,"Hello, occasionally headhunters will reach out to me about open positions via linkedin, but I have not accepted an offer as none of the offers are quite right.

I think I might get  more offers if I change the profile setting to say that I am looking for a job, but I am wondering how risky that is.  Do mid to large size companies have HR people check all current employees to see if the have changed that setting? Could they  check easily in bulk by spreadsheet? Does Linked have any measures to prevent this or do they encourage it? Does anyone have any insight about this?  Thanks"
293,"The best way to find a job on LinkedIn is not by using it as a job search site like Indeed.  Instead, find companies you would like to work for and then connect to their higher ups and not HR or recruiters.  This way when a VP of Sales, President or other higher up refers you to HR, you tell them you were referred by them.  This not only gives you a better chance for an interview, but also puts you at the front of the line because their boss referred you."
294,"I have only one past experience from 1+ year ago, I hate that it shows the company logo on my header above my education logo (which I'm fine with). Is there a way I can remove it? Thers an option to not show education in the header but I can't find one for the company or past experience"
295,"LinkedIn has recently imposed strict limitations on viewing and messaging which cuts most activity by 90%.  This was started a few months back randomly, but is being rolled out right now.  As far as getting an answer back from LinkedIn, you are very fortunate they even responded."
296,"I'm looking for a job in tech but my current role is sales so when I get the ""you appeared in ... searches this week"" it all says that most people search for sales so I feel it's hurting my chances of being found. Anyone know how to make this into tech? Should I just create a new account and merge my contacts?"
297,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I keep getting emails from recruiters saying that LinkedIn is showing them that I?m willing to work anywhere in the US. The thing is, I?m in the Bay Area and while I?m open to remote work, I want to stay in the Bay Area. Is there any setting I can change to show this?

298,"Stick to business-related non-political non BS posts.  Anyone can see anything you comment or post or like easily going through your history.

299,"Hi!

I have a number of experiences when I saw junior tech people who know next to nothing about the do the field to build seemingly strong LinkedIn profile.
But the last time, there was a dev on our team who continuesly failed to deliver issued task and was avoiding his duties with a number of excuses, paid sick leaves and vaccations.
After announcing he's ended on the project due to a serious medical condition from day to day, I went on his LinkedIn profile and I couldn't believe my eyes...

My plan is to connect to more readers and writers and grow as a community and hopefully when I publish I will have a good audience.

363,"The most easy solution is just to let her know you?d like them removed, if you contact Instagram it might be a bit more difficult since her account is private, so it?d be more of a hassle to show them the exact images you want removed, although I?m sure it can be done."

366,"Made a post a couple days ago with way more details, about my instagram account being wrongfully and randomly deleted completely by Instagram. I?m assuming, based on hours of research, that they must?ve assumed I was a bot (for?no reason at all. I also had zero violations and wasn?t told anything about why it was randomly disabled) and wiped my account off the internet out of the blue with zero warning.

I?ve sent about 12 ?mugshots? in those official instagram ?forms? to confirm my identity for them over the past 5(?) days so that they can reactivate my account, and still- no reply from them. No matter how I try to get in contact with them, nobody ever replies on any platforms/to any forms.

373,"I?ve posted the same post with slight alterations but the same hashtag sporadically throughout the last two weeks and they get a wildly different amount of views. The first time I posted it, 33 views and it was done. The next? 6,000 and a couple hundred likes. Then I redid the post and used a mix of old and new hashtags - stopped at 44 views and never budged. My hunch is that it?s all about momentum and you need a lot of likes and engagement right away for it to get pushed into anyone?s feed."

376,"I have a few thousand followers, and a lot are ghost followers, as I?ve had the account for like 8 years. I?m starting to delete ghost followers because they?re pointless. And I haven?t been getting a good reach and I think that?s because of it.

Has anyone noticed if getting rid of ghost followers increases your chances of your posts to be seen by your followers?

At other times the recording continues and the clips get uploaded as a new stories and stories keep on getting added if you keep holding the record button.

392,"I have recently come across an issue with my Instagram not crossing over to the Facebook page's story. Quick rundown below:

When I share a picture directly to the company IG story, it allows me to share it to the FB story as well. 

BUT, when I try to share a post from our feed (public) it will not share to the FB story (the FB icon on the bottom doesn't appear either when sharing)

The 2 other people who also have access to the account do not have this problem, one of which has the same permissions as me on the FB account.

The settings are enabled to cross-post from IG to FB.

This problem does not happen with my own photography page (also public and professional account)

I have checked all the settings possible and cannot find anything that fixes this. 

I have tried deleting both FB and IG and all the data for fresh installs.

I have tried removing myself and adding back into the company FB business team. 

Any ideas that I am missing?"
393,"Logged in today, the first time I?ve bothered in about six months, tried to like a post, and received the message, ?we restrict certain activity to protect our community.

My god."
394,"For example, say you made some fan art for a big account and were hoping they might share on their story or repost, and thus lead more people to your account.

Suddenly I got a screen which told me that there are suspicious activities on my account and that I have to verify myself on the phone app. I logged into IG and the selfie capcha failed to load, which means I cannot verify myself.

I re-installed the app multiple times, I cleared the cache/data, I even tried to login from another phone to see if my phone might be the problem. But nothing so far helped. I cannot write a ticket to get my account unbanned, because it is actually not banned, I just lost access to it, without any ''suspicious activities'' going on. I don't use 3rd party apps, I don't buy followers or likes and my account was new, because I created it last month.

I still have access to my old account but I don't use it anymore for reasons. Wrote Instagram on Twitter and saw how hundreds of other users are reporting the same issue, but none of us is getting any help. So I tried to create a FB account to link it with my IG account (selfie capcha enabled) but I can't link those accounts without login into my IG. I also can't use my phone number or e-mail address to verify myself instead.

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?

Edit: So 3 days later I was able to login to my account again without having to verify myself on the app. Maybe this helps you if you encounter the same problem.

So this morning I had no issues with instagram , but at around 12PM I just got logged out and when I tried to log in I got this message : ""Help us confirm you own this account"" , yet I have no choice whatsoever to actually confirm my identity just to Log Out lol

I reseted my password multiple times , tried logging in from a VPN on Opera aswell , also tried the ""Need Help"" trick where they ask for a Video Selfie , instagram said they confirmed my identity and now I can access my account yet when I try to log in I still end up on the same page to ""help us confirm you own this account"" , it's getting annoying , I can't just lose my account like this...

I have no phone nr. attached , the instagram account is connected to my facebook account , the account is not deleted on instagram as I can see it from my other business related account ,

Basically i'm locked out from my own account while having all the necessary information and data needed to log in but after trying everything I still ended on the page ""help us confirm you own this account"" on every browser and on my phone app and phone browser too... Anyone else having the same issue? What should I do ? Is it a bug? Will it fix? Should I wait?"
433,"Well something happened similar to my drawing account. It started with getting same notifications all over again whenever I open the app since yesterday night. About 2 hours ago I lost the access of my notifications tab. Now I can't see anyone who followed me, liked my post or commented about me.

Also it's not about the app on my phone, I still can't see the tab on any browser from my PC."
434,"hey, not sure if this makes sense but i have to physically tap the screen for the stories to move onto the next one. if i don?t tap it will continue replaying and it?s driving me crazy. 

i?ve also noticed that the top bar doesn?t ?load? or move along as you watch to show when you?re at the end of that story. 

i?m not sure if this makes sense but please help ??"
435,"TLDR: every 3rd to 4th post I do completely flops. Think it may be shadow ban but I've got no idea and would like any help or advice to stop it from happening

I've been having this same problem for about a year. I've tried a couple of things but nothing seems to have worked. Basically every 3rd or 4th post I do just ends up flopping. It's not like people arent interested. More like it just wasn't shown to anyone. Including people who follow me.

OK so basic to give a bit more detail. I post my artwork. I like to also post the breakdown of the work. So like sketch, outline, base colour, shading, final piece. It's usually about 6 posts per art piece I complete. In bigger projects its even more because there's a lot more detail and I spent more time on it so I want to show it off.

Because I'm posting the breakdowns I end up using very similar hashtags. Not the exact same. But definitely in the same field. So for example. Instead of #art I use #artwork then change it again on the next post. There is a bit of overlap from time to time. But majority of the time I use different hashtags for each post.

As said before. My main issue is after the 3rd to 4th post the post just completely flop. Like 2 people who follow me see the post and that's it. Then I need to wait about 2 weeks before any post is seen again.

I first thought is its a shadow ban. But I've looked through the hashtags on an account that does not follow me and my post still shows up? Which wouldn't be the case if it was a shadow ban right? Plus if I was shadow banded I got no idea why I would. My best guess would be for spamming hashtags because I use such similar tags? But I only post at most once every 2 days. And as said I try to use different hashtags each post?

I just would like to know if anyone else has dealt with this or if anyone knows what's going on and could help so I can stop having this problem.

Thanks for any advice you may have I really appreciate it"

I don't share anything on it. It was banned, contacting support only got me a response asking me to provide a mugshot (photos of me), which I refused, which lead to the account being permanently banned.   


I found this odd, I still couldn't wrap my head around the idea of forcing people to disclose their identity just to have an account, so I made another account, with a meaningless name again, same story, give us your info or we ban this permanently.... what's going on?"

444,"Firstly I have a large account which get's seen by alot of people so gets reported for no reason. I have been disabled and reactivated multiple times in the past but this time instagram is not replying to any forms at all.
It used to be alot different, instagram would reply straight away, and usually give you your account back after afew days once checking your account didnt violate any of it's terms.

A month has gone by since being disabled, and this has been by far the longest my account has been down.
The most frustrating part is complete silence from instagram account reactivation team. No response at all.


This form used to work well
https://help.instagram.com/contact/1652567838289083

Instagram used to ask you for a selfie holding a code, but the code has stopped turning up. They then used to reply back with their decision. 

This time instagram has introduced measures to stop you submitting the forms. It will say something like Woah, slow down looks like you're going to fast.
I recommend just submitting two forms a day. The ID one, and the explanation one.
Since i've Not been getting any emails asking for a selfie back from the other form it is a waste of time at the moment.

So we're limited to 2 submits a day, anymore and instagram will block you from submitting. 
Has anybody had any luck getting a reply from the forms recently? Which one did you submit?"
445,"I have recently restored my phone . I have lost all the data associated with my phone and lost the two factor authentication as well as backup code. So now I m unable to login into my instagram account as it asks either for the two factor authentication code or the back up code. I reached Instagram customer care and was asked by automated email to send a photo of my face with code which they sent in the email plus with my full name and username . After following this procedure, received an another email  ? two factor authentication has been turned off for your account, I should be able to login ? . However it hasn?t turned off and it is still asking me six digit code every time when I login . I have been trying to contact Instagram every day but am receiving the same automated email . Anyone please help me on this issue.?????????????????????"
446,"They restricted my account because I was unfollowing people I don't care about. I had over 2k people/businesses in my following but I would only see maybe 15 of the same pages every day? I just saw no point in following that many people. Plus there's people I follow back from High school that I have no contact with nor care to keep that contact... Anyway here I am restricted from unfollowing anyone because ""We have to keep the community safe from actions like unfollowing"" Which is actually laughable. This is the most dumbest thing that I've ever experienced. But it's not over yet, Instagram also won't let me like or comment on any posts because I unfollowed some people. THAT IS JUST WILD. How can reach Instagram about this? Would it even matter? And why is Instagram so... Stupid?"
447,I created a new account for my business and started following & liking a bunch of posts. I guess I followed too many people and liked too many things in a short period of time. Instagram seems to have flagged my account and says I apparently purchased followers and likes which I have never done (pretty rude of them to assume I have to pay people to follow me smh). So now my account is blocked from doing literally anything for a week. I tried to report this to instagram but they won't even allow me to report issues lol. Is there any way to get around the ban? Or do I have to wait a week? I need the account for business purposes urgently.
448,"I have a friend who is talking about opening a social media production studio in his town. I can't decide if it's a good idea.

Just wondering what your opinions are. If there were a full-service production studio space in your town, complete with private studio rooms, camera equipment, high-quality lighting, green screens, microphones, etc., maybe even in-house photographers/videographers and sound recordists -- would you pay to use it?

What price would seem fair to you? He wants to charge $95/hr to rent one medium-sized room with access to all equipment.

Would you prefer hourly or maybe a monthly subscription where you could reserve a few hours per week?

Would love any and all opinions! Just want to get a sense of if my friend is a genius or making a big mistake."
449,I believe they?d email you directly or just ban your account without notice if what they were implying was even remotely legit. No way in a million years are they going to dm you from some random account with some random link.

453," On linux Mint 20.1 Viber is working fine. 
 When installing the Linux Mint 20.1 system (it so happened that I installed it several times in a row on the same computer), I noticed that after installing the system, you must first update the system, and only then install Viber. In my first installation, I installed Viber immediately and then applied system updates - then there was an error message related to Viber."
454,"If I have a current Viber account and I want to leave all the groups I'm in (I'm in multiple groups), is the fastest way to delete my Viber account and create a new account with the same number again? I known this Wil not fix them messaging me again with the same number, but at least I'm not on the groups."
455,It probably can be done.  I have Viber on my iPhone and I also have an iPad with a SIM card that has a different number but I only have the iPad for data sharing. I have setup Viber on the iPad and I can use either or both as my iPhone is primary device of course.  Try setting it up and connect using the QR code thing and it may work okay.
456,"Try disabling hardware acceleration. Edit the C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Viber\gpu_blacklist.json file - you can carefully remove the device_id section for whichever vendor_id matches your graphics card. Mine currently is AMD (""vender_id"": ""0x1002"") so i just delete the ""device_id"": [""xxxx"",...], part. Alternatively you could add a device_id if you know it. Note: any update of viber overwrites this gpu_blacklist.json, so keep a copy somewhere after your editing and copy over when viber updates."
457,"Hello everybody. I had an old sim card, which I gave to my ex. Recently, I started getting harassed by a viber account using that number. I suspect this is his girlfriend doing the harassments.

I contacted my carrier, and they assured me that the number is deactivated.

My question is - how is this possible? I thought that you can't use a viber account without activating it through a phone?

Could it be possible, that they didn't get rid of the sim card, and they used Wi-Fi to activate it? What can I do?"
458,"I have a Verizon hotspot and it connects at 4g. However,  when using viber I can't get any call to connect.   I have to disconnect from wifi for it to work.  Any thoughts on how to fix this?

Also, I can't get audio to work through my Bluetooth in Toyota Tacoma.   Any ideas on this as well?"
459,"Like, everybody knows that Viber is probably the worst app for phone calls, the only reason I use it is because it's so widespread in my country, only because it was the first one to pop-up when the need for a free call came up, now, no matter how bad Viber is and other's are better, people just have a hard time switching.  


But that's beyond the point, this app receives more update than a live service MMO RPG and it's ridiculous because it's still a piece of crap app and no update notes are given most of the time, the heck is this? :/"
460,"Whenever I tried video calling in viber, It's always in loudspeaker and it doesn't let me switch to headset mode. I''ve been exploring the options and just couldn't find something that would help me. It's fine in regular call mode but there seems to be no headset mode in video call. It was fine when I was using Iphone6 but when I switched to razer phone this problem came up.
So if you know how to switch to headset mode during video call can you teach me how? thank you"
461,"I've just installed Viber on my Android phone and on my gf's iPhone. I've started a chat with her, which I've hidden on both phones.

However, I can find the chat on my Android phone by searching for the PIN code in the chats tab. But when I try to do that with her iPhone, I can't... Cause there's no search bar?!"
462,"Have anybody of you noticed that few months ago Viber switch from Google to Azure for in-chat translation? Now the quality of translation is like s\*\*t, I need to double check sentences is some situations on external Google Translate app just to be sure. This is ridiculous, instead of going forward, they went backward with this changes."
463,This started happening to me as well a week ago. Also tried to do the same troubleshooting steps you except for the third one. What I did is tried to install an updated version instead but still got the same issue.

467,I find it strange that Viber has to have access to our contacts. I hear horror stories about privacy breaches once that happens. It's a high price to pay.  I tried your desktop/mobile suggestion and did not have any luck
468,"So there's just this one person with this case, I can message her through my viber app on iPhone. But in my laptop, there isn't a message composition area. Our chat history (even the new ones sent through phone) does come through and syncs with our laptop thread. I just really can't send messages through laptop, and it's only for that one person. All my other threads are working just fine.

Some hypotheses:

Did she block me? Lol. But if she did, I should not be able to message her from my phone too, right? 

Does she not have Viber on laptop? But even then, shouldn't my typing from my laptop, just be received from her phone eitherway? 

Tried googling and checking viber support but haven't found anything.. so I'm turning to reddit for help haha. Thank you for your time"
469,"Every time I call outside of my own country, my contacts tell me they cannot see my number (it is either a +40 phone number or a hidden one)

To make a test, I tried calling without viber out, and they did see my correct phone number.

I also used other VOIP like Skype VOIP, and plenty of mobilevoip (justvoip, cheapbuzzervoip etc), and I didn't encounter such problems either.  


 2 of my friends are also reporting the same issues.   
We are all wondering how it can be that other aforementioned services can display your caller ID but Viber out only does it half of the time?  


For people like me it is a big problem because people either don't respond or just block your call if they see a hidden number, and if your number looks like a +40.... they literally wouldn't pick it up because they think you are doing cold calling."
470,"I suppose it save pics that I have clicked on? that's annoying. Is there any solution for this?

But again, I don't know if that is actually the correct address one needs to block. Someone may have to correct me."
475,"There is something odd happening in my phone lately (Samsung S10). No matter how messages I have recieved (unred messages) the app icon shows only the number 3. Even there is only one message or 100 the badge number is always 3.

476,"So, I would like to make a backup of my viber messages (text and audio and video messages), but I cannot find where viber keeps them. I am using android v8.

You may question why I'm sounding like I'm demanding an already-existing answer: Because this bug has existed for too long, and also because I saw another Reddit post (which comments are disabled for some reason) regarding this issue.

481,"Viber encryption is probably stronger, and definitely better documented, being a close cousin to the Signal protocol. it's also been reviewed by a third party for strength. Also, most importantly, the encryption is on by default for every single conversation.

Telegram's encryption is something they wrote themselves, no one else has been able to verify the quality of the encryption. They just tell us it's great. Plus, unless you manually turn on encryption, i believe it's not on. (Though i haven't used Telegram in years so i can't remember for sure.)

As for ""more people using it,"" the important thing is what your community is using. Here in Greece, Viber's the thing. in Turkey when i lived there, it was WhatsApp. in Iran, Telegram is most popular (counterintuitively, since they need encryption more that we do in Greece)"

I switched off the windows 10 Desktop and arranged for a call. This worked without any issue. At this point I tried again with the desktop back on and saw another failure.   


My next steps were   


1. Viber Desktop uninstalled. 
2. Windows 10 updates forced 
3. reinstalled Viber from the [Viber.com](https://Viber.com) page. Now showing as Viber 10.2. The problem persists.  


Viber on the cell (Moto G6 Play) shows as 10.2.0. This seems odd as the FAQ at [viber.com](https://viber.com) does not list 10.2.0

495,"what is the best way to contact Viber to have them help me

as I changed my mobile and can no longer verify with my decade+ # that I ported to GV

official:


Our top priority is to protect users from spam or harassment through our services. As part of our ongoing efforts to stop the abuse of our service, we?ve recently found that VoIP numbers are a significant tool in the hands of spammers. Because of this, we?ve taken action to block the ability to activate new accounts using VoIP numbers.

VoIP numbers that are already registered and active on Viber will not be affected, but new VoIP numbers will not be able to activate Viber. This also includes users with VoIP numbers that have changed mobile devices. Running Viber on the new device requires a new activation, which is not allowed for VoIP numbers anymore.

We?ve seen a significant decrease in spam reports since this change, which is great news for most users, but we are completely aware of the negative effects of this change on innocent users as well.

I do hope that one day we?ll have an option to allow specific VoIP numbers to activate Viber, but at this point in time there is no estimation for when something like this might become available. I know that this must be very frustrating and I?m sorry that there is nothing that I can do to remedy the situation.

Thanks for reaching out.

I ran into a quite interesting problem i can't wrap my head around, and i'm hoping you can help me.

My father and his friend use viber to communicate, and have had no problems until ~ 2 weeks ago. Now, however, only one of them can properly call the other.

508,"is basically app from hell. it should be used in every cs class as example of how not to build an app. here are main issues with how horrendous it is:

1) It is impossible to prevent it from updating. while it's super easy preventing from updating on the phone, same thing is impossible on desktop. it updates every time you run it, and presumably when you run it, you want to talk to someone, so what this means, is that **app will be preventing you from doing exact thing it was built for you to do**, to talk to someone. unless I'm mistaken, and app was built to update itself, in that case, sorry, I'm clearly using it for a wrong thing.

2) App won't let you silence and hide phone calls. Obviously while you're seated in front of your computer, typing something, reading something, exact thing you want is to be interrupted by a splash screen in the middle of your view, letting you know that someone wants to talk to you. I mean, I keep my bloody phone on silent, that's how much I care to pick up when someone calls, but this app won't let you simply silence and hide phone calls. Obviously we all have headsets attached to our computers and **can't wait to spend 2 hours forced to sit in front of computer, no chance of going to toilet**, cause friend who moved to another country feels lonely and wants to talk.

3) while you can't silence phone calls which no one uses except for that one friend of mine, and everyone prefers to type, you can mute and hide notifications of text messages. Cause obviously, being seated in front of computer with a keyboard that has keys bigger than your fingers is not how you want to type your messages. **why would you do that when you can type them over the phone, on miniature keyboard where spell check always has wrong idea on what you're trying to say. that's what you want, fuck convenience.**

4) worst thing yet, is that for some god awful reason, you can't turn off the stupid app once you run it. you click x, it seems like it's gone, but as soon as that friend decides to call you and interrupt your focus against your will, the same obnoxious splash screen jumps at you and covers exactly what you were looking at. **you literally, for absolutely no justifiable reason, have to remember that when you've apparently closed the app, you need to run task manager, and close it for real, from there. what the fuck is the purpose of x button if it does the same thing as - button?** what the hell made developers of this app think that when I turn this stupid shit off cause I want to sleep, I should be rudely awaken by someone who wants to ""hear my voice"" and has no consideration that i have swapped day and night?

like, what? were they even thinking when they built this app for a computer? or did they just pile some features on that make no sense, until they ended up with something that kinda works, in a way no one in their right mind would want it to work? ffs"
509,"hey viber, 

i have feedback that wasn't sent in your ticketing system. a person immediately responded. 

>hello <my name, 

>we will consider adding these features. Viber appreciate your feedback. thanks.regards, viber customer service. 

so here is the full list of my accessibility concerns for both the mobile and desk top application. 

- screen reader support for the desk top app. for those who does not know a screen reader is a program that helps blind and visually impaired users. it reads allowed the screen. [here is a video for those people who still don't get it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbl5jvLKGQ)

511,"I don't think they have paid version. They don't prevent anyone to use Viber for commercial purposes. In fact, Viber is superior to popular IM tools such as Skype for Business. It's faster, more reliable, better mobile/desktop apps,... Ofc, it lacks business collaboration features of the business apps.
I use Viber to communicate to my coworkers whom also use Viber. Whatsapp is also popular at work. "
512,"Where is it saving them? Is it saving in a viber folder in your pictures/media folder or in some system folder?

If it's the former, then something's wrong. Check your settings to see if it's acknowledged you don't want to auto-save and then contact support.

If it's the latter, Viber will have to download the images to show them to you. I imagine it will manage it's own temporary files and you don't need to worry."
513,"YES! YES! YES!

So annoyed with this. Does it to me on my Mi Note 3 and not to my brothers Mi Note 3.

Is this possible to accomplish? Or as I suspect I'm doomed to be seen by other users that know my phone number?"
517,"Here's how it goes:

&nbsp;

My father has two phones (one of which is android and the other a windows phone). His main phone is the windows phone (mainly due to lack of performance in the Android phone). He uses the android phone only in WiFi and mainly as an entertainment device. 

Today he came to me and asked me if I could install Viber on his second phone (already installed & registered account on windows). Now, I would lie if I said I am a frequent Viber user. In fact, haven't used this app for more than 3 years but since I know how to RTFM I happen to be the guy managing all my relatives' accounts/installs/tech-doodads etc. 

I remembered that I used to connect my Viber account to my windows PC. So on a first thought my answer to my father was ""it might"". He handed me his two phones and I started installing Viber on the android phone. 

I opened the app, inserted his (main) phone's number and as soon as the app asked me to verify the number by SMS/Call I stopped and raised flags. Why verify the number? I already had verified it in his first phone.

^careful ^is ^an ^understatement. ^You ^have ^to ^put ^the ^article ^under ^the ^microscope ^to ^see ^that ^you ^can't ^connect ^two ^smartphones. ^The ^answer ^lies ^somewhere ^at ^the ^""What ^will ^happen ^if ^I ^try ^to ^activate ^Viber ^on ^another ^smartphone ^with ^the ^same ^phone ^number?"" ^question

reading in [this FAQ section](https://support.viber.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1593168-using-viber-on-my-smartphone-vs-my-tablet-or-desktop) I came to the conclusion that Viber doesn't allow you to have a second phone connected to the account of the main one. 

But... why? Why Android tablets are allowed to have this functionality but Phones without sim card aren't? My father's android phone is basically a ^very^small tablet. Why can't he just use the app as it's intended to be used with tablets? "

So,   
1) Is there a way I can cap Viber's data usage, particularly of video? I know I can go audio only on calls, but I'd rather not unless I have to - for some reason it's important to family to see my face(!).

Tweet reporters, tweet FB....  I mailed screen shots to FB etc and they never responded,    Once it had been exposed that they were hacked again, I tweeted one of the officers that was quoted in a story and he actually reached out to me and finally did secure my account...   I am so sorry that you are having to go through that nightmare,  been there, done that, it sucks"
575,"Hey guys, 

Recently I've got my Facebook account hacked by someone who is using it for fraudulent activity with FB ads. What they do is they create a fake ad, and if you decide to pay on their website to order they steal your payment details. 

I noticed someone has been accessing my account when I received an email from Facebook Ads' support team that my ads account is currently suspended and I can't run ads. I don't use this at all. I changed my email on the account and the password as well, checked for any logged devices, but nothing unusual was showing, removed everything anyway besides my PC.

I got a bit angry because this continued for a few days, the person kept logging and creating weird ads which I removed 1-2 times, and stupidly (don't judge me) I provoked them in one of my opened chats one night. I basically told the hacker to go F themselves and find a real job. Four minutes later, I was logged out. My email, number, profile photo and name were changed. No way to recover it this way. 

That one's on me, I still regret being stupid before actually deleting my...stuff from shared photos. 

The person also blackmailed me and sent a private photo of me to a group chat with friends. The hacker said ""*please don't bother me*"" and also kindly advised me to never send a photo like that through Facebook because it's not safe. Very kind of them. I couldn't sleep or eat for 2 days straight from just imagining what this person can do to my life in a second. 

I have been in contact with Facebook ads team a few times, they only respond in macros and I got no help whatsoever, even though they confirmed my account has been compromised. I've hit every dead end. My worst nightmare became reality and to be fair it's all my fault. I should have been smarter. 

Does anyone have any tips on contacting Facebook in a way to actually get help? I'm also invested in finding a way to hack my own account, but that's a long shot (for now). I'm learning and studying on these topics while I wait for the person to stop being active on the account. 

If you've read all of this, thank you! 

*TL;DR: my stupid a\*\* got their Facebook account hacked, I'm now desperately looking for a way to get back in to delete my chats so I don't get blackmailed, Facebook's support team has not helped me so far.*"

This Company has scandal after scandal, leaks, security breaches, and questionable business practices. Over and over again it's been linked to depression, suicide, and addiction. Anything that may present an alternative they buy out, threaten, or squash. This Company wants to suspend me for something I said or posted over two years ago despite the choice my friends have made to view my content and most of the time it's benign or i'm left dumb-founded as to why it was flagged and my account suspended. Facebook should hold itself to the same standards as it does their NON VIP users.
  

  
I don't think I've ever hated a company more... maybe Comcast, but basically being put in a situation where my option is to be an online robot and bend over for some badly written Algos that were intentionally written that way or lose touch with my friends and family. It's disgusting how this company acts and then enforces. I hope congress breaks it up and I hope Zuckertwat is tossed in prison. We could have an alternative but Evilbook squashes or buys out anything that could become viable.
  

  
I hate this company and it's board+ Zuckertwat. Reddit is in some ways as flawed as overzealous mod will look for any reason whatsoever to delete or ban someone, but at least with reddit it's a mod who started or joined a community and not some backwards hypocritical Corpo oversight algos that do the very harm they purport to prevent. I guess I better screenshot this because apparently none of us our allowed to say how we feel about anything anymore without the censorship or opinions of some jackass behind a curtain."

My elderly parents are on there and it's really the only way they can get updates about my kids. 

It keeps saying that I entered too many codes and then when I enter the code, it says error or times out.

Well I talk to my wife, our kids, my parents and my acoustic duo partner on messenger, and that's it. What got this to happen? Well yesterday I said to my wife ""Another fucking heat advisory today. Shoot me now."" So it appears facebook AI saw that as self harm or some bullshit. I still have access to write on other's walls and post stories. That's it. And I'm using those outlets to let friends know that I am deleting my account. This site has become so toxic anyway. Posts that have nothing to do with politics end up getting a flood of comments full of political arguments. Trolls are all over the place. Scam pages. People impersonating celebrities. Facebook just sucks. And trying to get support when there is an issue is about as successful as scoring a no strings attached night with your celebrity crush. Fuck facebook. I'm out."

I already give up to my account... however I try to respond them in my free times just for curiosity."

594,"My account was hacked about 3 months ago.  FB has offered no help after many, many pleas for assistance and guidance.  The FB Security folks appear to be more interested in protecting the perpetrator than the victim.

With that in mind, I'm thinking about surrendering.  If FB has more interest in protecting the hackers than a good user, it makes you wonder how many FB accounts are real? In that frame of mind, why would I want to rejoin?"

If you do not have any other people helping manage your FB Business page... could the hacker have changed your ""role"" on the account? (I wouldn't think you would get notifications if the hacker removed you. 

I am sure you have already tried reporting a compromised account at https://www.facebook.com/hacked

 (I am unsure how businesses accounts work on FB since I do not have a business account). I surely hope you don't have any personal banking information on your account etc. 

Will it not let you reset your password via cell phone number or email? I was going to say, the hacker possibly deactivated your account (but you can still log back in when it's deactivated). I know there is an option to delete the entire account. (But if it was deleted.. I wouldn't think that you would still get notifications. UNLESS The messenger part was not deleted). 

My photo albums were missing when I logged back into FB after the ""outage"".. I was ONLY logging in to download my information and photos, so I could have them in a safe place and delete my account entirely.. but FB would not let me download my information and I could not find my photo albums. I wonder if the ""hacker"" is trying to submit ads through your account? But due to you still getting notifications via email, that means your email is still connected to the account. 

There's no telling what data was lost and leaked during that outage. I will ask my friends who have business accounts if they are having the same issues."

Shadow banning is the act of blocking a user or their content from an online community such that the user does not realize that they have been banned.

What it is, and why so many people are getting it without explanation is still to be determined."

Last year around election time I had a series of bans that were denied appeals. A couple were probably legit (heated conversations), but one got me banned for giving the correct date of the 2016 election (was considered misinformation for 2020). Another was for posting a ""sexually explicit gif"" which 1) wasn't actually explicit, just suggestive and 2) I found using their own damned GIF search tool. The worst part about that ban is that it came about 4 seconds after I posted it, meaning that it was 100% automated and they could have just said ""we're removing the picture"" without actually banning me for 30 days."

624,"Facebook is equally responsible with Trump for the tremendous increase in hate, anger, and partisan extremism and division in the last four years. As the whistleblower revealed, Facebook intentionally uses an algorithm that pushes angry, hateful, extremist and divisive posts and content because that maximizes their profit. This situation reveals the fundamental defect of U.S. capitalism: state law provides that corporations and their officers and directors owe their highest duty to maximizing profits for shareholders. We need a Federal Corporation law, governing corporations who engage in interstate commerce, that provides that the primary duty of corporations and their officers and directors is to advance the public interest, and only secondarily to maximize profits for their shareholders. This new Federal Corporation law would pre-empt any state law to the contrary.

Current state law forces all corporations and their officers and directors to act like sociopaths. It's time to end that."

I don't even use Facebook that much. I would be happy to just delete the account, except that you have to log in to do so! I'm not sure what happens if I just leave it locked ..."
629,"I got my account back

I had the same problem for two months! They locked me out- I kept verifying it was me and after a while I didn't even get the email notifications (that didn't work btw) to 'unlock' my facebook page. It would send me a link that just sent me back to a locked fb page and no ability to access. I left it for a few weeks because it was two months of consistent verification, I would email back the case managers who sent me the email and after they sent me another dud link they just wouldn't respond... I filled out all the forms available like 5 times each... changed the passwords, did all the things.

Then a week ago decided to give it another crack just for fun and for some reason they changed the verification method to 'name your friends' and I had to name like 5 people from my friendship group. All of a sudden I got access back immediately. I don't know how but if you keep going you might get a different verification method.

I also made sure to opt out of them keeping my verification for more than 30 days, but kept sending in the same one. Maybe it's my tin foil hat but I'm a little convinced because I gave them bare minimum for two months they weren't going to get anything more, they just changed the verification method to collecting data on others haha"

631,"I've been following this sub for awhile and people successfully recovering their account seem to be few and far between.

I can think of two things to do.  Since you've lost control of your account, your account is now basically an imposter account.  You can report an imposter account here [https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295309487309948](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295309487309948) without having an account yourself.  I believe facebook's remedy is to delete the account.

The second is that you hold copyright to your stuff on facebook.  Since you no longer control it, it is infringing.  You can report infringement through the DMCA process.  It is here  [https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1758255661104383](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1758255661104383)

638,"Deactivated my account after the Cambridge Analytica stuff became public knowledge. FB, through gross negligence in pursuit of profits, quite literally allowed a foreign bad actor to socially engineer its users in pursuit of political gain and ultimately the subversion of democracy.ÿ That?s not hyperbole. That happened and it is beyond unacceptable.   
And let?s not forget the laundry list of other fucks ups.   
1) Facebook, like others, uses MASSIVE tax avoidance schemes by using foreign shell companies. Literally removing billions of tax dollars from the US. Tax dollars the American people deserve (be it in infrastructure, healthcare, defense, or any other federal spending that helps this country and it?s people function).ÿ  
2) The personal information of over 530miilion FB users was lifted from FB in 2019. The companyÿdidn't even notify anyone it had happened and claimed to have ""fixed"" the problem. And this was just a couple months after FB was fined 5billion for misusingÿits users data in the past. And then a couple days ago... over one BILLION users' data and personal info appeared on a ""hacker site."" Guess FB did a real good job fixing it last time.  
3) The free flowing disseminationÿof foregin state sponsored and generated mis-information meant to deceive and manipulate the American people. Facebook happily allowed itself to be the single largest collaborator in psychological warfare against its own users. Again, that's not hyperbole.  
4) The free flowing dissemination of blatantly false and easily factually/scientificallyÿrefuted dis-information from charlatans, snake oil salesmen, and profiteers which propagates lies and false claims. This has lead to not just a growing anti-vaxx community, but now actual deaths in the middle of a global pandemic. Did FB outright kill over 700,000 Americans? No. Did FB provide the singleÿlargest spread of anti-vaxx information that mislead thousands of people and undeniably lead to countless deaths? Without question.  
5) Provided a platform for the vast dissemination of hate speech, extremist recruitment, and organizing efforts which in turn fuels radical extremism and domestic terrorism. Accordingÿto PRIUSÿdata, ""Nearly two-thirds of extremists (64.53%) used Facebook for radicalization or mobilization between 2005 and 2016."" That was more than double the next two platforms combined, YouTube and Twitter. While Facebook, glacially, made moves to squelch Islamist extremism, it continued to allow massvie amounts ofÿWhite SupremacistsÿandÿAnti-government Extremists to continue spreading hate, calling for violence, and organzing.  
6) The abuse of Content Moderators. Be it through FB corporate of a third party hired and given unrealistic goals by FB. People are literally suffering emotional and mental distress, and are being diagnosed with PTSD because the nature of their 9-5job is not only horrific (looking at beheadings, child porn, torture, animal cruelty, violence, and so so much more all day everyda"

It isn't clear to me what they excluded these people from, but assuming it is automated moderation tools, which makes sense for Facebook to do as these tools might block important content published by public figures such as, for example, politicians. Plus, AFAIK Facebook has no legal obligation to moderate as per their own rules, they only have to respect laws, so they might want *some* controversy on their platform as it generates chatter and clicks."
641,"Facebook seems to be going nuts flagging everything as spam. The worst part is that not long ago, you could disagree with the decision and they would put it back. Or if they didn't put it back, at least they would message you back telling you to get over it.

These days, I disagree with the decision and it looks like they don't even review it to say I was right or I was wrong.

647,"Early Sunday morning (8/15/21), my Facebook account was compromised. The hackers added multiple phone numbers to my account. They posted content that was flagged as child exploitation in order to get the account shut down. They then spammed the system with 2FA requests so that I can no longer request a 2FA code without waiting 24hrs at a time. When I do manage to request a 2FA code, Facebook tells me something is wrong, and doesn't give me a field to enter the code in, even though the code does arrive on my phone via SMS. 

Both my Facebook \*and\* Instagram accounts are banned. Almost every form, link, etc. takes me round in circles or doesn't work. The nature of the attack leads me to believe it was personal, not an attempt to take my money (although today someone tried to rack up purchases on my Google Play account, so this bastard may have decided to dump my info for scammers to use, just to make sure I was as screwed as possible. The Google account, however, is secured now).

There is no way for me to appeal the ban on my account while I'm locked out of it and checkpointed. My Instagram account has also been disabled because of the nature of what the hackers posted from my account. 

Facebook tells me there are 27 days before the account is permanently deleted, which will erase a decade plus of connections both personal and professional, as well as the biggest platforms I have to promote my freelance work, which is my career."

649,"You are able to access someone else's messages without password? that's a security risk, breach to privacy. It's not a glitch, since you are still able to do that after uninstalling and reinstalling. If more people know this, there will be more lawsuits against FB."

Some people buy Oculus headsets and use their support to get their accounts back.  It has worked for many, but not for others.
  
Facebook should provide a reliable way for us to get our accounts back.
  

  

  
We're not going to be able to get our accounts back because Facebook doesn't currently have a way for us to do it.  Some people have successfully gotten their accounts back through Oculus' tech support.  To do that you have to buy an Oculus headset on Amazon for $300 and then report to Oculus that you can't set it up.  It takes more than a month to go this route.  Recent reports suggest this (Oculus) route no longer works.
  

  
A lot of people are losing decades of memories.  Facebook has become storage for photos, anecdotes, and other things for so many people.  It's incredibly thoughtless of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook not to offer some way to restore accounts.  It is clear that those who handle account security at Facebook are not just negligent, but are incompetent.

655,"Facebook is equally responsible with Trump for the tremendous increase in hate, anger, and partisan extremism and division in the last four years. As the whistleblower revealed, Facebook intentionally uses an algorithm that pushes angry, hateful, extremist and divisive posts and content because that maximizes their profit. This situation reveals the fundamental defect of U.S. capitalism: state law provides that corporations and their officers and directors owe their highest duty to maximizing profits for shareholders. We need a Federal Corporation law, governing corporations who engage in interstate commerce, that provides that the primary duty of corporations and their officers and directors is to advance the public interest, and only secondarily to maximize profits for their shareholders. This new Federal Corporation law would pre-empt any state law to the contrary.

Current state law forces all corporations and their officers and directors to act like sociopaths. It's time to end that."
656,"Something similar happened to some of my friends. Here is what worked for them. You should go to the Oculus support website and chat with them about your situation. Facebook itself does NOT allow any FB users to communicate with anybody in main FB (which is outrageous). The chat support people at Oculus can provide guidance on how to open an Oculus case to allow them to get FB to re-check/unlock your FB account. You will need certain important info such as serial number of your Oculus device, BOTH your FB e-mail AND an alternate e-mail address and other info. If you have to buy an Oculus device, buy it from Amazon or Oculus so you can get your money back in 30 days if they can't fix your account. Good luck."

I think the most efficient thing we can do is wait, I was suspended and then I was blocked from what I had infringed. So I think I was blocked because the AI ??thought my identity on Facebook it was usurped or I was someone fake.

sounds overkill but the only solution I have been able to find is to just create a new account and report the old one. Seeing how face book has no actually customer support."
664,Same here. The amount of data that FB has on each and every single one of us let?s them come up with a personality profile that could be up to 99% accurate. Based on that I have a feeling that Facebook randomly blocks a few accounts they feel could be dangerous to their cause whatever the heck that may be. I know I?m sounding like a conspiracy nut right now but that couldn?t be farther from the truth. I?m no one?s fool but I don?t go around posting random stuff on FB especially considering the neck of the woods I live in.

Anyway, someone else commented that they had a student called FatMan and that?s the only name he?d respond to. Efforts to call him ?John? or whatever were wasted and so I commented on the post: ?can you imagine (as a teacher) yelling out hey fat mannnnnn your moms here? everyday in car line?? For that comment, Facebook put me in jail for 24 hours stating it was against their standards due to possibly bullying, harassment, hate speech. I would never do any of those things so I told them the comment was out of context. Yet I?m still blocked from posting or commenting for 24 hours.

I have no idea why it says this. I've tried submitting my passport and my driver's license.

Since Facebook does not offer any real support to its customers, is there anything I can do to get my account back or is it pretty much a lost cause?

Also, if it is a lost cause, is there any way to permanently delete my old Facebook account or will it just remain locked forever? I keep getting emails that the hacker is trying to access my Facebook account, so I'm nervous that they'll be able to access my account unless I fully delete it.

679,"Like many, my account was hacked in August. Email was changed and 2FA added so I had no way to get back in. Took the steps to verify my ID and was able to change my password, but still got stuck at the 2FA stage.

I decided to try to regain access to my account through Oculus. Here are the steps I took:

First, I went to Target and asked to look at one of the Oculus headsets in stock. The serial number for the unit is printed on the side of the box. I took a photo of that number and handed the box back to the Target worker. No sale.

At home, I went though this link: [https://tickets.oculusvr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://tickets.oculusvr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and clicked ""Chat with Us""

Before the chat begins, they ask you to enter a summary of your issue. The first chat box in Screenshot 1 is what I entered. Importantly, I provided the Oculus serial number in the chat so they assumed I was actually trying to use their product.

(I attached screenshots of my entire chat, in order. Hopefully they are posted in order so you can follow along.)

The chat then begun and I spoke with the representative about my issue. Eventually they asked for information about my FB account so they could elevate the issue to their FB support team.

The rep told me it would take up to 7 days to receive a response, but it actually took over two weeks. I never followed up with Oculus, just trusted they were still working on it. Finally, I received an email from Facebook asking me to reply with a photo ID to verify my identity. I obliged, and two days later I received another email with a link and 8-digit code to reset my account and bypass the 2FA. It worked! I was able to reset my password and log in without the added security checks.

I cannot guarantee this will work for everyone, but I wanted to give a detailed guide for everyone since I know many are still without access after the recent hacks."

When signing in to account on either iOS app or Desktop, it seems the ?News? section has disappeared. It does not appear in shortcut bar, it does not appear as a feature to add to shortcut bar or even in the menu section. ?News? is MIA. Not talking about ?News Feed?, I am talking about ?News? where you can view popular and recent news articles. The issues occurred yesterday and the last iOS app update was more than a week ago. See both [attachments](https://imgur.com/a/pyKe7GA/). I took screenshots of my test account signed in and the account experiencing the issue. Both on same device and same iOS app minutes apart. You?ll see where I scroll down right after the account name and profile info to the first icon/section.

Troubleshooting steps already taken:
Turned phone off and on
Delete/Reinstalled iOS facebook app
Signed in and out of account
Signed in to account on desktop version, issue persisted. ?News? did not appear.
Signed in with NEW test account on same device, same iOS app, same software version. Issue not replicated. ?News? appeared.
Checked all settings in Facebook iOS app, could not find anything.
Checked location of account is based in one of the countries where ?News? has been released.

My suspicions:
I feel based on previous troubleshooting steps taken above that the issue is account based and I don?t think there is anything else I can possibly do with the tools I have to fix this rather than report a bug to Facebook and just wait it out for Facebook to do something. To me iOS, app software, iPhone hardware and accessible account settings have all been ruled out?

I am really only trying so hard to get this resolved because it is for a family member and my experience in the IT industry makes me intrigued that I cannot resolve this issue.

Please let me know if any of you have any questions or need any clarification. Again, I appreciate any help or ideas. This has stumped me.

Auto moderator removed my first post due to short title, so hopefully this works."
682,"The ""limit old posts"" functionality doesn't let the user choose which privacy list the old posts shall be limited to, forcing it to ""Friends"". I'm trying to limit all my old posts with the Starred friends list, and apparently the only way is to do it one by one.   


Thing is, every time I start doing this, after a while Facebook decides to temporarily block me because ""I'm doing this action too quickly"". Now, I'm aware of anti-DDoS measures, but this is against the EU GDPR Policy: Facebook willfully prevents me from rectifying my personal informations.  


I've sent a complaint to Facebook support, but time is passing by and I really feel the urge to change the privacy for all my all, 18 yo me cringey posts. I believe this is a Facebook fault, not giving us the choice to limit old posts, and I think they are doing this to keep sending more data to insertionists. Disgusting."
683,"Hi I am having the same problem, but at the step with uploading an ID photo Facebook does not respond. I?ve done this process like 10 times over the past few months and have never gotten a response. I used an email that was previously associated with the FB account, would that be the issue?"
684,"How do you add another email to a hacked account?

Mine got hacked yesterday and shut down, and the hackers are actively using my Facebook business account to run their own ads. There is no way for me to stop it besides charge it back with my bank and I?m obviously livid just at their mercy."
685,"I got my first 30 day ban 3 days ago because I said an historic building getting torn down was a crime against humanity. Apparently saying that was bullying or some fucking bullshit. Fucking been on zuckbook since it started in 2006, have a large following for my business page that makes me about an extra 10k a year but since Facebook decided to ban everyone over anything around Sept 2020 it?s been unusable and needs to be replaced with something else that will forever maintain the right or free speech no matter what. Fucking piles of dog shit at Facebook? saytging that would get me banned forever; but seriously fuck them and their happy monopoly."
686,I was a member of a popular meme group on Facebook until I noticed I stopped getting notifs and posts on my timeline. I searched the group but it didn't show up. I figured the group was disabled so I asked my GF to search it and it showed up for her. I messaged the admin and asked if I was banned and he told me I wasn't and sent me screenshots showing I wasn't. I believe this to be a bug. Any ideas? Thanks.

It didn?t make sense to me at first that ?60 Minutes? would do a whistleblower story on Facebook?they?re on the same team.
Do your own research, of course, but it will make sense later?.the overlord is using the media to set the stage to justify a government agency sensoring what is on all social  media?all under the guise of protecting the children.  They will take away our freedoms little by little as they use the Rona as a distraction.  Their narrative is slowly coming unraveled.  Turn off the TV.
2 years ago if anyone told you of a ?pandemic?, lock downs and face masks you would have thought that couldn?t happen?not in our great country.
(I don?t usually go so out there, but at this point?we can?t just keep accepting what they want our new normal to be). Pay attention to the big picture.
Think of all the things that make no sense right now.  Enemy infiltration."
689,"My account was hacked 2 weeks from  Friday and the password was changed I was logged out and cannot get back into it 

Email is still the same but the account is changed to just Facebook user if you try and search for it it doesn't come up 

Tried using the forgot my password tool it sends me a code but once I put it in it says ""we limit what you can do.... try again later"" 

Waited it out a week to see if that would work but still same thing 

Doesn't seem to be a way to contact FB support any suggestions?"
690,"Following.  My personal page was hacked on July 24, 2021. My business fb page has been scamming people on the Facebook marketplace selling different vehicles.  I have sent fb my driver's license and birth certificate.  They still are not giving me access to my 15+ year account.  In the meantime, my business name is destroyed by the scammer."
691,"No but based on other peoples experiences, I've started deleting tons of my posts. No matter what the post says or whether or not it's controversial. ""I ate a boiled egg for breakfast"" could be something I'll delete. FB has algorithms that pick up things and just call them violating community standards.

I also delete my posts in FB groups if someone becomes contentious about something I post. I delete the original post so it deletes the entire thread with it's nasty responses along with it. This usually makes the nasty posters upset.

I have reported a few personal attacks and FB deleted the person's posts."
692,"Hi reddit,

I normally wouldn't post here, but Facebook's developer forum won't let me post. I've asked FB reps, too - no dice. Perhaps one of you will be able to help.

When I create a post in Business Suite that contains a link preview, the preview shows up fine - image, title, and description. However, when I post, all but the title disappears. (this is important because it affects engagement.)

I've used the debugger tool many times to help fix this. I've scraped the URL multiple times. I've specified the og: image, title, and description tags. The link preview still shows up correctly on the page, but not when we post.

If anyone is familiar with FB business suite (or could direct me to a more relevant subreddit, if this isn't the right place) - please help.

Thank you!!!"
693,"That's funny because Facebook just banned me with an accusation of faking information in my profile (they cited section 3.1 of the Terms of Service), but I've used my same real name for the entire 14 years I've had the account.  All I ever post is family pics and updates on how we're doing living overseas.  Facebook requested an ID, but then stopped communicating after I sent them one.  They rely way too much on their inaccurate automated systems to determine if a profile is fake or not.  In my case, I was a false positive and lost tons of family photos because of it as well as contact with all my old friends from when I was in the Marines and even some family.  In your case, a false negative which should have been obvious if a human would actually look at it."
694,"The same thing happened to me twice already. It just happened again yesterday for me. It is a known glitch that Facebook hasn't been doing anything about. You do nothing of that nature and suddenly Facebook says you shared something child porno or sexual stuff - posted it, sent it in a message, and you're blocked from doing anything for 72 hours. Very pathetic."
695,As of last week about 1/3 of posts on the news feed are random posts by people & pages I don?t follow. I?m assuming they are doing this on purpose and everyone else is getting it too. It?s bad enough they already have 1/3 an ad. Now my friends posts are getting to be less and less.
696,"Same issue here, though I'm still on that timer. Got hacked, and illegal shit was posted through my account.

Now they ask me to request an SMS code, and then it tells me my phone number isn't correct (DESPITE! Getting the code.).

Add insult to injury, I've been on a ""please wait for 24 hours to request a new code"" at least 48 now.

Is it really as bad as some people show on here?"
697,"Not related to this issue but please help: ""You Have Limited Page Functionality"" This message being displayed on my page for almost 1 month. Already tried contacting Facebook Support but they can't do anything. Account status is restricted. What is the way forward?"
