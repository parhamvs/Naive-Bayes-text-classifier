"So lads I was wondering why doesn't Telegram bring chat heads function. Facebook Messenger has it and it's very handy . While chatting , it's very painful to go to the app every time just to send a message. Android 11 has bubble feature , but what about us ? We want Chat Heads :(",Telegram
"Same issue here, can?t access on my iphone xs max, ipad and my laptop. Surprisingly, i can access just one group chat and send stuff there. And this has been persisting close to 24hr. I definitely need a fix for this soon!",Telegram
"I had the same issue, and it seems the only way I found to fix it is to open the Settings, scroll all the way down to the ""Default Interface Scale"" section and change it to a higher setting. By default for me, it was originally at 150% and all of the conversation bubbles were aligned on the left side of the screen.

When I changed it to 200%, then it showed my messages on the right and the other person's messages on the left, just as it does in the mobile app.

I have no idea why this setting should change the chat bubble alignment, but it does.

"I would seriously doubt that employers would track you on Telegram since it's not that popular in our neck of the woods yet. However, just to clarify: even if they found your account, there's no way for them to know what groups you're in and who you're chatting to.

Should they find your account, they'd just know your username, see your profile pic and see your bio - if you have set any of those things. But to even find your account they'd either need to know your username or phone number. **But** you can restrict your account from being found via phone number if you have a username set. So your employer puts your phone into Search and finds nothing.

For security, you can use Secret Chats to make sure only you and the person you're talking to can ever access the data and only from your current devices. I also highly recommend enabling two-factor authentication. Not because of employers, just cause it's a good idea for any account on any platform.",Telegram

"There are so many things to improve in the stickers department, like letting you have more than 5 favorites, or the option to hide stickers from a pack, but instead we got a feature for adding more and more entire sets of which we will use an average of 3 or 4 of each.

What's saddens me the most is knowing that this was **the** killer feature that made most people switch from Whatsapp until last year. 
Now they copied it too, and even though it's very flawed, they got a few critical points right: You can have an infinite list of favorites, stickers can be added on a one-by-one basis, and the most important one: you can use third party apps to create and update stickers. This is key because this kinds of apps let you crop and resize pictures, add text and decorations, etc, all in a friendly and visual gallery-like UI.

"A contact on Telegram is a person whom phone number you have in your actual mobile device or you added them as a contact within Telegram itself. Full list of those people you can see by opening a menu in Telegram app and entering ""Contacts"" sub menu.

Not everyone who you see on Telegram group is a contact, you can add them as one ~~but it has to be mutual, they need to add you as well~~. If you enter a public group or someone adds their friends to your private group, those people won't be able to see your profile photo. That's why you can add a group for permissions, so no matter if person is a contact or not, as long as they are within that group, they will be able to see your profile picture.

Btw, you can talk to people even if they aren't your contact. Having people as contacts allows you to have more of a ""trusted friends list"" that potentially you could have different permissions for.

"> whats the purpose of manually clicking on download when having autodownload? Im guessing its either just for chosing another path to download the file or maybe it doesnt get as compressed by downloading it this way?

Your first guess is correct, you just choose where to download. So sometimes the file is in my Telegram folder on PC but I'm too lazy to navigate to it so I just re-download it directly to the desktop. Files don't get compressed when downloading though, no matter how it's done.

> Thing is, doesnt this get clunky when someone sends a bunch of files (like a lot of pictures)? Do I have to be clicking them all one by one?

For this, you can choose what gets autodownloaded based on size or type. So files above, say, 5 MB will not get autodownloaded while smaller files will.

I haven't gotten messages so far. Though if someone tries to message me on WA will notice I will literally take hours to reply. Hopefully they will wonder if there's still a problem with WhatsApp and encourage them to reach me out on Telegram.

These messages are annoying. I think someone should raise a feature request to have such an option in the channel or group settings. Having a bot is not a solution as some group owners have no right skills.,Telegram
"Search ""@"" anywhere to find any mentions of you or replies to you. (works both in general search and a specific group).  
Searching ""+"" shows every messages in a group. You can find out how many messages are there.  


You can make multiple question quizzes with limited time to answer using `@QuizBot`.  


Use "":"" to search for emojis while typing. (e.g. :angry )  


You can actually view messages without making it two-checked (other person won't realise).  
Turn off your internet connection, view the message, then completely quit telegram (force stop it in android / ctrl+q for desktop) and finally reconnect your connection and open telegram again. (tell me if i'm wrong)  


Hold on version info down below in the settings two times and you open debug menu, use only the options you are 100% sure what they are. E.g. ""read all chats"" is a useful one.   


For having a image inside a message (not an image with a caption), make an invisible link inside a zero-width character at the beginning of the message. (use the image address as the link)  


While typing a message, when the attach button is gone, you can use the three dots button on top instead to attach media. (i've tried android)  


In general search you can use date tag like this: DD/MM/YYYY or MM/YYYY or YYYY . Results are always separated in chats/media/links/files/music/voice in general search by default to find easily.  
Also search in messages of a specific group by searching its name in general search and then selecting the group as a search tag. (combine these with the ""@ trick"" and that would be really cool. Imagine finding your mentions and replies in a specific group at a specific time)  


View counter under channel posts is not actually unique views. If someone views a post and again views it 4 days later, the second time also counts. (after 4 days it resets that you have viewed it before or not) (that 4 days are different for different users and it depend on the first time they view the post)

"**SOLVED**

I am the owner of several (in fact 100+) Telegram group chats that I use for school.

People complain when someone sends a message after midnight or very early in the morning, so what I would like to do is add a bot that automatically deletes messages send between 12 AM and 6 AM or come up with a similar solution.

Do you have any suggestions regarding this? Manually removing permissions is not an option since it's more than 100 group chats.

"Read receipts are against privacy and shouldn't be there at all. It shouldn't even be optional, just not there. Not a fan, really.

This is the simplest act of privacy Telegram is ignoring.

Telegram is very good, but turning every emoji into cringe animations or adding weird no-one-asked-for features don't make it better. Sometimes you just need to keep the app as it is.

Edit: Read receipts will also create social anxiety and hurt those who already are socially anxious.

[https://webwormhole.io](https://webwormhole.io)

I'm very happy to communicate this idea!?? (Trust me, read!)

The thing is this:

>As you may already know, in your contacts app you can always set important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.).  
So, whenever someone I have a great relationship with creates himself a Telegram account, I set that day as ""Telegram's anniversary"" in the aforementioned date input. (Yes, I'm quite a Telegram fan??)

Yes, it's nice to celebrate with someone your year spent chatting on Telegram (in-person talks are always better, though??). I do this in a ""rudimentary"" way, by replying to the first-ever message in that chat with some celebrative and emoji-full text.

To conclude, the idea I just came up with is that maybe some kind of ""alert"" (like the ones that appear when someone first creates his account) could appear, to celebrate the special date!

Also, having the same animation as when having a nice shot with the ?? emoji when you enter that chat during that day (or, if that doesn't occur that day???????, in the following ones).

I believe this could add sentimental value to Telegram chats over the ones on other platforms. Plus, sense of achievement like those fires in Snapchat (we have to accept those fires worked for the social network).

I'll look at this from the scenario that durov likely considered (oppressed countries/regimes)

Let's just say you are a journalist in one of those countries and you and your contact are having a conversation, in the event one of you know the other is/going to be compromised you can delete the conversation on both sides to erase any traces of your conversation (which might have sensitive information about you on his messages)

"Do you have enough space on your device? Time depends on size of your local database and free space on your device.   
In my case Telegram required more than 2 GB to rewrite 1.5GB of local database and it used all available space on my device (It scared me with 0B available). Now local database is about 2.2GB.   
Quick fix:   
\- Don't close telegram, let it open and let it work until the end.  
\- Scroll down to see if older chats are without previews  
\- If everithing is fine you have done!  
\- If older chats don't show text in chat list it means that there was not enough space to rewrite the local database. You can do two things:  
\- Free more space on your device, close telegram and then open it again to start the entire process  
\- Go to settings and clear local storage (it doesn't affect secret chats and cache in my case), close telegram and then open it again to start the optimization of a smaller local database

I know about the official Telegram backup system, but what I dont like about it is that the Human-readable HTML export does paginate messages and there is no graphical way to search for messages / text inside it.
I need to search inside the chat history of the backup and so I'm looking for ideas / alternatives.

What would you suggest for my case?
Is there maybe a better backup system (better if open source code)?

Or maybe someone created an app to view and render the Machine-readable JSON backup files?

"Continuing my series of guides, I?ve seen a whole bunch of misconceptions about how storage works in Telegram. So today, I?m gonna do a few tips on managing your storage and downloads through the app.

So let?s go into Data and Storage in your app. First two options you see are Storage Usage and Network Usage. That second one is **stats** on how much data you spent downloading stuff on Telegram. Honestly, I rarely use it but it?s nice to see the number sometimes, especially if you got a limited data plan. Still, the one we really want is Storage Usage. 

On iOS, you immediately see two key sliders - **Keep Media** and **Maximum Cache Size**. The first one determines how long files are kept on your drive before they have to be redownloaded from the cloud to access them. The second one decides how big your cache can get. So even if you choose to keep files Forever - nothing above your chosen limit will be saved, the *oldest* files will be wiped to make space for new ones. They?ll still be available in the cloud but will have to be downloaded again. Personal suggestion for these two - **1 month and 20 GB**. You?re not likely to need anything more and the lower options are for those with less storage, which is rarely an issue these days. Plus, **remember that you can clear cache manually at any time**!

Next - Automatic Media Download, split into Cellular and Wi-Fi. The big thing here is that it?s all broken up into **categories**: *Photos, Videos, Files*. Need to get all photos downloaded but only a select few files? Easy. Only care about videos? Two taps and you?re there. Note that you can **go into each category** to modify its settings too - which type of chats do they always get downloaded from? How big can the video/file be before the auto-download stops? That last one is hugely important unless you want some random 300 MB video to be downloaded over and over every time you clear cache. Saves time, saves space, love it. The **selection by chat type** is pretty cool as well, I tend to leave photos on for all chats but videos in groups are a manual download for me, especially on mobile data.

Auto-play Media is, y?know, fine. Unless you see a ton of GIFs in chats and they annoy you, you won?t care much about this. Same goes for how much data calls use, unless you?re a big businessman guy. iOS also has a section dedicated to saving media. You can choose to save incoming photos and ones that you?ve edited in-app. The former one I wouldn?t recommend but the latter can be good if you?re using Telegram to polish up some pics. Also, if you don?t have **Background Download** ticked, go to the bottom of this section and do so.

The last part is for the **Desktop** version. These settings are in **Advanced**, the second batch. First off, you can choose your downloads folder, which is nice, especially cause I had no idea where mine was at first. Then you can also manage local storage with pretty much the same settings as on iOS. You can also clear cache ve",Telegram

On the ""distributed key generation"" discussion. The only way this becomes relevant is if there's absolute separation between servers. However, realistically, all of telegram's servers need to be able to communicate either to each other directly, or through a leader-follower architecture.

"In theory once you delete the chat on your end the files are also deleted, but we will never know for sure. I'm not even sure how Telegram can efficiently know when a file is no longer in use unless they maintain a record of every chat a file exists in (eg forwarded to) and delete it when that record is empty - which is a lot of overhead, or periodically search each file across all chats to see if it's still referenced - which could take a lot of time for billions of files across billions of messages in millions of chats, some of which may not have been accessed in a long time. 

This is why I believe Telegram should release their server-side source code, otherwise it's possible they have taken the easy option which is bad for privacy - that storage is cheap, so keep everything indefinitely and figure it out later without telling users their deleted files aren't actually deleted.

Files sent to bots can be accessed via the Bot API long after they have been deleted from all chats, and in the past it was possible to do the same from the regular API until they introduced [file references](https://core.telegram.org/api/file_reference).",Telegram

Yes, you have the chats on the server, but that to me it's inferior to a local backup for a couple of reasons:

- a backup is a snapshot at a particular time. This is important especially in Telegram where everyone can edit or delete messages or entire conversations. This is a big limitation of Telegram. 
- you can also delete by accident chats and messages and you want to recover them (a backup serve also to protect from accidental damage)
- you can loose the access to your account, for example the phone number you used to register is no longer accessible and there are no longer sections active, or you didn't use your account for more than a year and it got deleted, or you set up a two factor password without a recovery email and you forgot it. 
- for what we know, Telegram can close down tomorrow and you loose all your data. You really can't trust a cloud provider to provide its service at the same conditions forever, it will certainly cease to exist some day, or change its policy by limiting the amount of data you can store with a free account, who knows. Having a local backup to me is fundamental. 

A synchronization mechanism as the one of Telegram is not a substitute for a backup. Ideally you want both of them, a local backup like WhatsApp does, and the chat in the cloud to be able to access them from all devices. The fact that everything is in sync on multiple devices would also increase the number of backups and thus decrease the possibility to loose data.",Telegram

Second one is: what if the owner leaves and is later added to the group? Are they the owner of the group again or just a regular member?",Telegram
"Back again with another guide! I?m pretty sure you all know that you can easily use more than one account on Telegram. Whether you do it on one device or several is up to you but today I?m gonna lay out the basics and show just how many accounts you can actually run at once. The guide will obviously assume you have the SIM cards to create all these accounts so I?ll skip the ?buy a SIM? step whenever applicable. ;)

First things first, you can easily have three separate accounts running on a **mobile** Telegram client. Simply open your user profile and hit ?Add Account? to do so. On Android, you can also use Telegram?s direct download version, which is an APK available from their site. That?s another 3 in the bag. Lastly, you can also try Telegram X, which does not have a limit on the number of accounts. So using *only* the official apps, you can get to **3** and **100+** accounts on iOS and Android respectively.

Next is the **web** version. Depending on how many browsers you have on your phone and whether you?re willing to keep an incognito tab open in addition to a regular one, you can have multiple accounts per browser, whether you?re using WebK or WebZ. Do note that the web versions currently don?t support multi-account logins, so one instance of web = 1 account, which is why having an incognito tab is important as it effectively creates a new web login.

On to **Desktop**. The start is the same as mobile - side-menu, down-arrow next to your name and ?Add Account?. But don?t forget you can also get the Telegram Portable version, which acts as a separate entity from the regular Desktop app. So that?s another 3 accounts. Not sure what the Mac ecosystem is like right now, but last time I checked there were two apps you could install as well, meaning both Desktop options net you **6** accounts.

So with web, Android and Desktop you could easily be running *20+ accounts*. What you would do with them is up to you, I just wanted to clear up that the power is there. Also, importantly, I wanna note that all these accounts will have separate notifications settings, so if you have a main acc and a backup one, you can mute the backup easily while still getting all the notifs from the main one. Especially important for work/personal accounts.",Telegram
"The question is in the title.I assume that it's some sort of a feature, but maybe my google skills are lacking and that's why I can't find any mention of it whatsoever on the internet.

I also tried using some Bots for this purpose but they also reply with the same error.

If anyone else has encountered this issue or knows how to solve it please do share, it will be much appreciated, thanks.",Telegram
"Title says it all.

A few chats in particular seem to be stuck on mute or whatever. Though, to be clear, Telegram and Android all say notifications for them are on.

Other chats and notifications work fine, obey mute / unmute settings.

EDIT / UPDATE:

I have figured out (I think) a solution that seems to work when this happens. It's a bit of a pain in the butt, however it sure beats trying to factory reset the phone or such (which might not work anyways), etc.!

Thanks to /u/PicadorDeBits for making me take another look at how Telegram acts when things are logged in / in view on another device, say the in-browser client or the Windows Desktop client, etc.; this lead me to the solution described below!

**What worked for me (and hopefully for any of you having the same issue):**

1) Find your phone, the one with the number that your telegram account is registered to.

2) Using that phone, go into the Telegram Settings menu (not the Android menu for Telegram, the Settings menu inside the Telegram App).

3) Go to Devices.

4) Tap 'Terminate All Other Sessions', and confirm by hitting 'Terminate'.

5) Reboot your phone, and any other devices previously running Telegram, just for good measure. (Probably not necessary, but, can't hurt!)

6) At this point, some (if not all) of the notifications for chats previously not working, will likely start working again.

7) If you find that one chat is not working still, sign into the Telegram Web client (web.telegram.org), and select the chat that notifications are not working for.

8) Select 'Mute' from the menu in the upper right. 

9) Select 'Unmute' from the menu in the upper right.

10) Close Telegram in the web browser. Notifications should work normally now.


EDIT 2: I hope someone from the Telegram dev team or such stumbles upon this and can explain to me more in detail what exactly happened here. (And hopefully fix it so it doesn't happen again in a future update!) It seems to be related to the way Telegram stores the settings for which chats / groups / etc. to notify you of messages from, and how. 

It seems that voiding all the other sessions forces it to void out any settings submitted by clients who's sessions have been voided, thus it then 'obeys' the user when they don't have the notifications muted on their phone. Again, not sure *why* this is, but it seems that something just gets 'stuck' as a (possibly not even in use anymore) device has some sort of priority over the notification settings. (Not sure how it even stores them, but they are definitely propagated between devices for most chats, so it must be server-side.)

Setting the chat to 'Mute' and then 'Unmute' in the desktop client seems to force it to overwrite anything still 'stuck', which while that didn't seem to work on it's own, after voiding all but the one Telegram session on my personal phone, did seem to resolve the remaining issues.",Telegram
"I've come across a huge problem. I logged into telegram with a new number, however I am now logged into the previous owner's account and can see all of their private chats. What should I do to unlink it? Huge violation of privacy",Telegram
"Hi!

I'm having trouble getting Telegram on my MacOS.

So, this is my experience thus far:

A) I download Telegram for MacOS. I only have this device, and then an old-school cell phone with no access to internet.

B) So far so good. The application is up-and-running on my MacOS. The first window to pop-up is a ""Sign In"" page. In order to sign in, I am asked to provide my cell phone number for a confirmation text. I do so but do not receive any texts.

D) Suddenly, I realize that I must first register with Telegram (duh). The program advises that I open the application on my mobile device in order to sign up. However, I do not have a smart phone and therefore I am not able to complete this step.

E) I try web.telegram.com and I get a window which asks me to sign up by, once again, providing a phone number which is able to receive a text from Telegram. I attempt to give them my cell number but I do not receive a text.

So, is it actually possible to register without a smartphone? Why do you think I am unable to receive Telegram's text messages? (I tried two functioning numbers, btw.) Any advice?

All help appreciated!

So that?s one way to approach it?what are the problems that exist for employers in your industry? Come out and say something like that to show you understand what they?re dealing with. Then, give a couple specific examples of how you have solved similar problems. The About section factors quite a bit into the algorithm, so you should also make sure that you?re using keywords relevant to the type of position you?re seeking, preferably in context (not just a list of terms/skills).

A secondary purpose of LI is to show if you?re likeable/someone that people would want to work with. It?s entirely acceptable to include a sentence about your hobbies outside of work and to take a more conversational tone than in your resume.

Caveat: this will all vary based on your level/industry. Some people can absolutely get away with something more clever/fun because that?s what the industry dictates; if in doubt, keep it more conservative but still include more than just the boring template.",Linkedin
"Yeah it seems these days that's how you get ahead, my ex-boss was fired from his role and now on linkedin markets himself as a really big executive director when in reality he was basically a junior manager, he hired a branding guy who did his linkedin profile and now regularly posts and shares articles and highly inflated job title and descriptions.

I know for a fact its all BS, i know him very well personally and still in touch with him. its working for him, he just landed decent business consultancy work through linkedin using this strategy!

He knows how to talk BS and is slick with his words, so he has no problems following through even if he gets an interview.

General advice I got was that you should only put stuff that is relevant to your career.  If nothing is, find a way to spin what is to be relevant.  In other words, you're better off putting under the table or small contract work on your profile as being ""self employed"" than putting 6 years working a menial to pay your school bills.

However, menial jobs can demonstrate that you have team leadership skills or whatever.  Especially if you were promoted to a team lead or something.

"Yes, there are many fake listings on LI. Scammers always find a way to scam, so even LI isn?t safe from that. The one I hear about most often is the overpayment scam where they tell you that you got the job, tell you they?ll send $X for you to purchase equipment, and then send you more money than they initially said. Then, they tell you to wire back the remainder, but by that point, their check has bounced and you just paid them to scam you out of a job offer.

"This ""LinkedIn is becoming Facebook"" trope is tiresome. If you are seeing content you don't like in your feed, then edit your feed. You are in control of what you see or not. Ranting about it on Reddit is cliche and just shows you don't know how to use the platform.

Secondly, professional content is LinkedIn's niche, but it's a pretty narrow niche for a social media company. I don't know where you got the idea that a person's humanity has to be absent when on LinkedIn and that everyone needs to be a corporate. I don't think even LinkedIn thinks it should be a platform for only professional content. If that's your interpretation of LinkedIn, fine, but it's not everybody's. And it makes from a pretty dull social feed.

Thirdly, the pandemic has blurred lines between work and personal. More people are working out of their kids bedrooms or getting new pets to keep them company while working alone. There will be a natural spill over into LinkedIn as people's own professional lives meld with their personal. But again, if you don't want to see this stuff, then edit your feed. It's not everyone else's responsibility to create content you like. Connect with people who provide better content you value, and mute those who don't.",Linkedin

"I assume the answer is no... but want to confirm before our company gives up on LinkedIn Learning:

We used Lynda sporadically, but like many small businesses, it was good & useful to have for a bit of training here and there.

I created a ""dummy"" account just for LinkedIn learning for our company, doing my best to make it anonymous and ""not real"", and disable all the LinkedIn nags... of course it got blocked because I forgot LinkedIn is a social network. ??

They strictly do not communicate with anybody who's not signed in (which is infuriating by itself), and under my personal account, the help chat is unavailable and the online info is unhelpful to understand what licensing models are available for Learning at companies. There's something about Group licenses, Enterprise licenses, and detaching one's LinkedIn profile from their Learning license.

From what I could understand... all of them require setting up the company on LinkedIn in a more thorough way, and activating Learning on employees' individual LinkedIn accounts? I'll need the President to assign me as some kind of admin to manage it? Is that even an option? How much more does it cost than a single individual Learning subscription?

All that kind of setup makes sense for them (data-harvesting, increasing engagement and all that)... but probably not what we want.",Linkedin

"Hey, It?s not just the software you need to think about. To safely create more than just a few accounts a VPN or similar connection will simply not cut it. You should be using high quality 4G proxies to get around IP detection systems and create each account on a fresh IP. Residential proxies are great for 1 or 2 accounts, but what about 25 or 50? A 4G proxy makes all this possible as the IP rotates at regular intervals (I rotate mine after every account created). You will also receive bans if you are taking too many actions too frequently or your proxy/connection isn't adequate and consistent. The most advanced bot users know this and put many steps in place to prevent bans, not just a proxy. You must also find a way to get around 2FA, look into temporary/burner phone numbers for this. Currently, 4G SOCKS5 proxies are the best proxies around, you can get a reliable 4G proxy from [Kingdom Proxies](www.kingdomproxies.com) that will be super high quality and fast.

"LinkedIn Recruiter is a license sold to companies that enables them to use all of LinkedIn profile data as the source for talent to fill a job, vs. just having access to the resume content of people who apply to a posted position. Indicating you're Open to Work highlights your profile if you appear in one of their searches. 

It's helpful to remember that recruiters using LinkedIn Recruiter, as well as those doing simple searches on LinkedIn, all do things differently. They all use different settings on the LinkedIn Recruiter software, they've all been trained differently and they all make different search choices. There's no real way to know who is doing exactly what with their LinkedIn Recruiter license.

One can gain higher visibility to recruiters using LinkedIn Recruiter by using the Open to Work indicator, but just having content on LinkedIn makes you ""findable"" by recruiters and other people using simple People searches on LinkedIn. 

Technically, a company licensed to use LinkedIn Recruiter can't see the Open to Work indicators on LI profiles of employees that work for them, but there's no real guarantee. A recruiter could ask their buddy who works for another company and uses LinkedIn Recruiter to look someone up for them, for example.",Linkedin

Country A: lots of jobs showing up but as it's a developing world country there's virtually no chance that any of them are going to be worth considering.

I still interact with my network, but by actively searching for content I find worthy of being interacted with (instead of being forcefed by the LI feed). For example, I search for posts that contain certain keywords, sorted by newest first. Keywords could be a conference I've just attended and I want to interact with other attendees.

"Hello, I've picked up some work for a company as a contractor. They've added me as an admin on their page so that I can run ads. However, since I don't work for the company, I don't have the credit card to use on my own ad account. Is there a way for the owner of the company to add a credit card for billing another way or do they have to give me the number to put into my own account if I want to run their ad? Thanks in advance.",Linkedin
"It?s by no means required, but it can be a good way to let your network know about the new gig and thank your former colleagues publicly. Admittedly, these posts sometimes make me roll my eyes, so if it?s not your thing, that?s fine.

This is a format I find works pretty well:

I am excited to announce that I accepted the position of (title) at (company). Their mission of (mission summary) aligns with my own values, and I?m excited to work on (General description of projects). 

I am so grateful for the time I spent at (former company) and for the guidance and support of (coworkers?tag them in the post). Let?s keep in touch!

You can play around with that. Be sure to tag all people and companies mentioned in order to increase reach. I don?t think this is a great way to attract recruiters because they?ll know you JUST accepted this job that you claim to be excited about?but you never know. This is more so to give give yourself a pat on the back, get some validation, shout out the people you liked working with, and give everyone a heads up that you are making a switch.",Linkedin

"We got a notice to take down some content posted by an individual on LinkedIn. This content was actually photos. This person gave us until the next day (U.S. time) to take down the content, but we took it down well before that. The person who asked us to do it seemed litigious because she was just really irate. She thought that we were lying about something, but she now sees that we were not lying about anything. That person recognizes that it was just a misunderstanding. There was lying involved. Nobody lied. So, it looks like all's well that ends well. She is no longer talking about lawsuits or anything like that. She just recognized, in the end, that it seems like a misunderstanding.

We spent a bunch of time in our company trying to address all the issues. Two questions: (a) this seems like all that needs to be done, right? Should we do anything to protect ourselves legally? (b) how do small startups handle the heavy demands on time that situations like these put on our employees? Also, this stuff leaves us completed out of gas. It is about legal threats after all. It affects both productivity and employee morale. Any thoughts from startup founders or startup people on how to handle this?",Linkedin

"With the caveat that there are terrible recruiters who will never do the basic research on you before contact you about irrelevant jobs, you can do a few things to cut this down.

1. Remove the programs you don?t use from your About section, as suggested above. Focus on what you DO want. It also makes you look more positive in general.

2. Remove any skills you DON?T want to use from your skills section. This also plays into the search/SEO, so you can remove things like Java and pin your preferred skills/types of projects to the top of your skills list.

3. Put some keywords in your headline; something like this:

Software Developer | AWS DevOps | Gitlab 

That will also factor into the search and even if they don?t read the About, they?ll likely see that.

As the majority of courses are bite-size learning, they don't have the same standing as a professional course that might lead to a qualification (although some are linked to professional qualifications such as PMP). But they for sure give you great insight into the latest trends, skills, and insights in a given topic area, and they for sure show potential employers that you're actively engaged in continuous learning. 

The course names generally also include great keywords for anyone skimming your profile.

Have a profile and resume with plenty of details.  Apply to lots of jobs daily and mark your profile as 'open to recruiters.'  Respond as soon as anyone pings you.  Be prepared to interview and start immediately.  Have references lined up that will answer the phone or return calls quickly.

"Lots of job postings listing the location as [location]/remote.  I complete an application, I hear from someone a bit later, learn a bit about the company and the position, then it turns out that it's not remote at all.

"I find it difficult to give specific advice without knowing your industry and/or job title. If you could share at least one of them you might get better replies. But generally speaking, use your About to describe what you do (or want to do, if you're looking), and use terms for which you want to be found. 

For example, my About starts with my job title followed by the company name and our main products, but only because my job title happens to consist of relevant keywords, and our products are quite well known. If you have an odd or overly specific job title, don't repeat it verbatim but in a simplified form that people understand (and search for). I also include a few qualifications, credentials, certifications...  basically those acronyms recruiters like to search for. 

Then I have a short paragraph written in more natural language that describes my career, but aimed at readers who look to hire someone for a role that would mean career progression for me. If that doesn't make sense - look up job descriptions for positions you would be interested in, take note of what they specify as requirements/responsibilities, and describe yourself around some of those terms. And again, use words that people search for - job descriptions can be an excellent inspiration for that as well.",Linkedin

"Over the past few years I've ended up completing a lot of online courses from platforms like Coursera and Udemy which I enter in the certificate section of my profile and I am fine with that representation.

Since, these are short, free & don't require much effort, I don't want to display these with my other certificates for which I have invested significantly more effort. But I do want to mention these in my profile.

Currently, I just add these certificates without setting any issue date so that they get accumulated at the bottom.

Is there an elegant way to combine these certificates and display as one? For example, all Kaggle certificates under Kaggle microcourses?",Linkedin
"Yes , there's different views. 

1) Full profile - so when you view another person's profile they'll get a notification saying you viewed their profile and in that notification they can see your photo , name , and the summary. 

2) Place of work - So say if you're working/studying at a place X, with this option they'll get a notification saying Someone working/studying at X viewed your profile but they don't know it's you.

3) Private - They'll get a notification saying that someone viewed their profile but they don't know from where or who it is.


So irrespectivly they'll get a notification saying that someone viewed their profile but depending on how much information is provided to them depends on the option you choose.

"Hi r/linkedin

I have an annoying issue. As the title says i have a linkedin profile, and all manner of sellers, advertisers, event organizers, expat ""advisors"" etc find it. They see where i work, call the reception asking to be forwarded to me.

This happens all the time, and i'm getting a little fed up. They are extremely pushy, speak as if they know me, not pausing for me to interject etc (i'm a bit of an introvert and maybe too polite for my own good).  
Problem is i need my linkedin, obvisouly. 

I work for a large company, and as a policy, the recpetionists cannot deny callers being forwarded. Neither would i excepect them to. For all they know it's legitimate and i am sure the caller make themselves out to be. 

When calls are forwarded they are shown as coming from the reception (just the way our phone system works) so there is not really any way for me to see the original callers number until after i pick up, and i obviously do not want to miss any important or legitimate call.

I have read about recruiters doing this, which is not really my case but i suppose this falls under the same ""umbrella"".

Anyone had this issue and found a way to stop it?",Linkedin
"We recently interviewed LinkedIn Expert, Mandy McEwen, on our show and she dropped some gold around how to get more reach and build your influence on LinkedIn.

Here are my notes and takeaways...

**Messaging & DMs**

* It's so rare to get a genuine message from someone on LinkedIn. When reaching out, talk like you'd talk to someone if you bumped into them in person. Don't send pitches or informal messages.
* Don't ever send a link in your first message to someone.
* Don't ever get the person's name wrong when messaging them (happens way to often when people are copying and pasting messages).
* Do automate your communication. Be a human and interact like a human.
* Get permission before sending someone a link off of LinkedIn.

**Growing a Personal Brand**

* We all have personal brands, whether you want it or not so you might as well start owning it.
* LinkedIn is severely lacking humanized content. Only 1% of users post consistently.
* Just by focusing on posting consistently, you'll immediately stand out. If your posts have a ton of value as well, you'll really start to gain some traction on the platform.
* None of the platforms like it when you use the scheduling tools. But most businesses do content marketing this way. If you are trying to stand out and leverage your personal brand, you have to try harder and don?t schedule everything.

**Curating Content for Posts**

* You want to be seen as a trusted industry resource. This can be done easily with curated content. 
* Don't just share links and other posts without context. Add your own commentary when curating posts if you want to be taken seriously as a thought leader.
* When sharing articles, give your thoughts on it, simplify the concept in your own words, and some sort of additional value with the share.
* Start leaving comments on people?s LinkedIn posts. Then you can turn those comments into your own posts. All you need to do is copy and paste five comments into a document, and then you have five posts that you can leverage. It?s easier to respond to someone?s posts than to come up with your own. 
* Mandy uses her account for experimentation and has found that Linkedin prefers the following:
   * Polls get the most interaction. If you want a poll to go viral, talk about something recent in the news.
   * Documents that you can flip through. PDFs can be easily made in Canva and uploaded. LinkedIn seems to be giving these some additional reach at the moment.
   * Next, try every type of post from images, videos, text only, and LinkedIn live.
   * Personal posts do well, and even better if you can put some personal motivation behind them because we are all craving that human to human interaction.
* Mandy goes live on LinkedIn once a week and takes clips from those that are 30-90 seconds long and uses those as posts.

**Cool LinkedIn Features**

* Using video is great, although people get discouraged because the views are so much slower. But you can?t look at those metrics because the vide",Linkedin
"It?s all about your headline. That?s what people see even before they click to your profile. Google tips on customizing your headline. 

You?ll build more connections if you appear in the feed more: like, comment, engage with others posting about topics you care about. 

To be more noticed by employers, make sure you have the right skills and buzzwords on your profile. Imagine a recruiter is looking for someone like you: what kind of software/skills/specifics are on your profile to ensure you appear in the search results.",Linkedin

LinkedIn put a stop to that in April with limiting the number of connections to 100 per week, instead of 100 per day.  There are still multiple ways to generate leads on LinkedIn without advertising or spamming.  I get at least 5 appointments a week just by adding a little sentence to the top of my summary.  

I have a blog on my site which will give you free tips on how to effectively market on LinkedIn without having to spend money on advertising or spam people.

"Hi Everyone,   


I am trying to add my company to my profile (been active for 3 weeks, has 10 employees, etc.) but when I search for the company  when trying to add it to my experience, its not there. There are a number of companies with a similar name ""Otto"", so we can only see it in the drop down when we change the company name to something else.

"*In this guide, we?ll talk about LinkedIn Marketing and elaborate on how you can increase engagement on LinkedIn and build an audience for yourself. We?ll also provide some tips and tricks to help you get started.*ÿ

*Do you want to build an audience on LinkedIn?*

*If so, this blog post is for you!*ÿ

*Let?s dive in!*

You and I both want the same.  
To be loved; to be recognized. To feel valued.ÿ

We want to be on top of the wave and stay there, visible.

No matter how shy, no matter how introverted and humble you are. Bullshit, **we all want to be heard.**ÿ

They say you cannot have a million friends. Don?t trust them; it?s a trap to tell you you can?t do better than them.ÿ

There are no **big secrets** to building an audience and increasing your LinkedIn engagement, just hard work, and discipline.ÿ

Yeah, it takes time, creativity, and brass balls to play the engagement and growth game without burning out or obsessing.ÿ

Wanna see **the results**?ÿ

Work on your ideas, support your community, embrace the everyday challenge, and overcome laziness. Keep your friends close, but your enemies, oh yes, keep those ones even closer.

But you know, those increasing vanity metrics only make sense when you feel genuinely supported.ÿ

Those likes transcend when you start seeing your community shaping a conversation around your topics, debating, agreeing with you through elaborated and interesting arguments, disagreeing with you from the deepest bitterness of their souls.ÿ

Yeah, it sounds rough, but it sounds like real life. And that, in times of corona and social distance, feels like golden.ÿ

**Building a real audience takes dedication.**

You can build it from scratch if you?re willing to invest some time and [share content that matters](https://funkymarketing.net/how-to-create-a-b2b-content-machine/). Patrons are fuzzy here, but there are some steps you can keep in mind in your way to grow and engage. No matter your industry or niche.ÿ

Ready? Let?s make this **growth** thing happen.ÿ

## Before starting with LinkedIn Marketing

So, you wanna start **attracting attention** to your LinkedIn profile. That?s cool, but do you have **what it takes**? Check out your profile, is it descriptive enough? Are your skills and personality reflected on it? If I click on it without knowing you, will I find anything interesting or catchy at first glance?

These are the types of questions you need to have covered before starting to **build an audience** on this social channel.ÿ

As we navigate the internet, we scan the pages first, and we focus our attention on those things that catch our eyes at first sight. That?s why you need to **take care of some key parts** of your LinkedIn profile and update it.

What to check before starting building your audience?

* Header banner

The upper side of your LinkedIn profile is the first thing people will see when they visit you.

Ideally, you?d like to make a **great first impression**, so take care of this as you?ll take care ",Linkedin
"> Many people appear on both lists.

That's because when you connect with someone, you automatically follow them (and they follow you). You can then unfollow them but remain connected, just like you can follow most people without being connected.",Linkedin
"Around 3000. To confirm, open the editor, and copy and paste ""1234567890"" until it tells you that your post is too long. I don't know how links, mentions, and hashtags are counted.

On a side note - you can always start a private/invisible group, with only you as a member. Then you can post in there to get a realistic preview of what your post will look like, if the formatting is right, possibly even where the fold starts, and so on.",Linkedin
"Individual might want to promote one's employer for various reasons. I think it is useful to do that especially if you are in B2B sales. Many of the active members on LinkedIn are working in sales. In sales it is crucial to make your network aware of your employer or the product you are selling.

Other times it is beneficial for your career when you are identified as the face of the company. That might be if you worked on c-level or similar position in public office.",Linkedin
"I used to be able to edit parts of the company name whilst keeping the logo and link to the company page, but now it completely cuts both on both desktop and mobile. Is this no longer possible or am I just losing my mind?

"Long story short, I have decided to go no contact with my family because they are abusive and mentally unstable. They are very angry about this according to the few emails they have managed to get to me. I have not spoken to them for months, all while being young and trying to network to get into my career field during a pandemic. People always tell me that LinkedIn is one of the most effective platforms to use however I don't know how beneficial it could be to someone in my situation. I currently have an account that is out of date and not used because: 

* I do not want my family to know where I am located or employed out of fear of harassment and defaming my character with lies. Even with the most private settings on, your profile is still searchable on google to some extent and to anyone with an account which displays your photo, current location and place of work. 
* I have a network on there that consists of friends, former classmates and other professionals who I am still in contact with regularly. I do not want this to be visible to my family out of, again, fear of harassment towards them like they have done in the past.
* It isn't seen as professional to use a pseudonym on this website like you can for other social media platforms, which I am doing. I have thought about a total name change but it would be a very complicated process to change and reverify all documents I have such as my degrees.
* According to some experts, leaving a profile private could also leave the user less visible to prospective employers and networks. Moreover, a lot of jobs are being solely posted on LinkedIn these days which is also leaving me out of applying to them since I cannot update my profile. 

My field of study is quite difficult to get into as it is, and not being able to use my LinkedIn account like my other former classmates is putting me at a serious disadvantage. If anyone has any tips, tools, methods or advice on how I could get back on this site; I am open to all of it. Thanks in advance for your help.",Linkedin

"LinkedIn is for far more than job hunting. You should create your profile and show your current employer, and describe your role and what you love about it today in your present experience. This will actually demonstrate to your current and future employers that you're an engaged and motivated employee.

I'm applying internally to positions as well, but I would like to keep my options open.",Linkedin
"My 1st account was restricted. I made it a couple months ago and barely used it, and didn?t even connect with anyone or search anyone. Now I am on a job hunt and wanted to start using it seriously but it?s restricted. The only reason I think it could be is that my profile picture is not of me. It?s not of anyone else but it?s just a generic landscape photo that I was using as a placeholder until I had a professional looking photo I wanted to use. 

I heard linkedin will notice your IP address if you make a new account so I  turned on my VPN and made a new account (definitely just made everything worse) with a real photo and that account was restricted as well.. clearly they?re too smart for the VPN lol. 

I uploaded my ID in hopes that they?ll unrestricted my account but I?m not sure if there?s any hope, especially after making the second account which was an additional violation. Is there any hope for me ever being able to have a LinkedIn account?",Linkedin

No time to even respond to you if you weren't selected. A recruiter also has a quota of offer/accepts to meet or be fired. Fired is bad.

I was actually contacted by those companies previously when I wasn't doing this. But I think posting all this work does help, after you apply to said companies when they review your profile. It shows that you are actively working in your field and displays passion towards the subject. When you say experience do you mean how it is received by people? If so, then I would say mine has been average. But it doesn't matter to me , I kinda do it for myself at this point more than anyone.

I could put it in volunteering, but that gets pushed down a lot. Additionally, I'm currently a volunteer at 2 other organizations which are already listed there - but my work with them is much more sporadic.

Finally, I could add it under organization, or projects... but that gets pushed even further down, and there's no real space to explain my responsibilities.

"1- Do you have a current job? I assume you don't as you wouldn't want to be so public about this experience if you had a reason to keep it confidential

2 -  You thinking the match was perfect doesn't mean they thought it was. I recommend asking the hiring manager or recruiter, graciously and gratefully, for feedback on what they thought was missing, so you can learn and grow from the experience, with the intention of applying again

3 - The way you conduct yourself with the recruiter & hiring manager really could make the difference on whether you get a crack at this opportunity again. I've seen it more times than I can count. Silver medalists are the first to get the outreach when a new role opens, and your interest in this role and your grace in accepting that it isn't yours NOW but could be eventually, will get you another chance at this.

"I wouldn't even put the employment agency. It's just where your check came from. You actually worked for the company itself and I'm sure you can speak to that capacity.

I'm currently doing the Master Microsoft Excel path.  

I have bookmarked the following paths I want to dive into.  Most are over 8 hours long, if not 24 hours long with multiple certs:

* Master Outlook

* Master Power Point

* Master Python for Data Science

* Master SQL for Data Science

* Master Microsoft Word

* Becoming a Business Analyst 
    * Data Analytics
    * Excel Stats
    * Data Visualization
    * Power BI
    * Tableau

I use SAP everyday and I wish I could get live training on other modules of SAP or expanded training on my current module I work in.  I'm also a part time MBA student as well.

I've been told that it's not possible to choose specific people that you want to ""block"", specifically to disappear from their contact suggestion list as well not appear if they look you up. Is it true or is there a way around it ?

"Many members who have been on LinkedIn for a long time have built up followings and connections around their profile. Others create more content. Others are already in their ideal job and need a reason for LinkedIn to be more than a resume site to maintain a profile.
 
Creator mode essentially turns your profile from a resume to a 'thought leadership destination'. It changes your 'connect' button to 'follow' (because a creator wants followers, not connections); it downgrades the resume-type sections on your profile (like Skills) and elevates your content - articles, posts, presentations, etc. that you regularly post. 

It's not for everyone. Really only those who create and share content on LinkedIn, or want to grow a following. If you are using LinkedIn to only find jobs, then stick with your current profile.",Linkedin

LinkedIn should be a professional network site and NOT a social or religious idea spreading site.

Research some good hashtags to spread your content. But don't go overboard on it. LinkedIn isn't Instagram. I think 3 -5 is what it likes right now. Looking at the hashtags competitors are using might be a good jumping off point. 

 Have a variety of content types. I link to my company's web page, blog, YouTube channel. I use images and text a lot. Sometime just text posts are good. It depends on the content. 

Have a regular posting schedule. I saw huge improvement in our engagement once I moved to a daily posting schedule. I started with a 3 day a week posting schedule.

"Hey all,

I have recently been approached on Linkedin by these 3 women (with whom I had at least over 5 mutual connections) and I want to know what is up with them....like are trying to scam me or get me to join an MLM?

So here it goes!

I connect the first two women despite having no common ground between our industries (I am majoring in accounting while they are involved in healthcare). I connected them solely because I was new to the linkedin game and just wanted to get my connections number up :/

I connect the third women, who this time, is from my university and is doing the same degree as mine (just that she is a year ahead of me in the degree).

BUT! Here is where things start going weird........

\*Not sure if relevant\* All of them were Indians who are living in Sydney, Australia (Which, I am an Indian-Australian myself, so I kinda see a connect)

At all times, the ladies initiated the conversation WITH THE EXACT SAME INTRO! (I mean literally the same, even the same emojis)

All of them have a part time opportunity for me

All of them want to talk to me ONLY AND ONLY via phone (Which I wasn't comfortable giving out my number)

All of them always skipped/ignored any question I asked about the opportunity within the chat like its industry or company

All of them ghosted me once I said that I was too busy for a call (which I wasn't) and gave them my email ID for further communication

I genuinely have no clue what this is?? Like how I filter such people out when I connect to others on linkedin.

Any advice or anyone have an idea about this situation?

Thanks",Linkedin

I graduated from college recently and noticed a trend during searching for a job where positions that are supposed to be entry level say 5 to 7 years experience required. How is this allowed? I filter my searches on Linkedin to only include entry level jobs and none of them say anything lower than 2 years of experience required. I've done a lot of academic internships fortunately so I have a year of experience already which I thought was a lot for someone who recently graduated. How can they post that the jobs are entry level if entry level is supposed to mean you just graduated and likely don't have much experience?

"These recommendations are always garbage. Yes, the connections are important but if you can?t answer the WHY- then it?s just fake internet points. 

LinkedIn is a tool, remember that, and if you can?t answer why you are using it to reach whatever objective, then go for a walk or step away from it. So for you, I can infer that your why is to build a network of collogues in your new country where you don?t have a network for job opportunities, professional advice, or probably just some social aspects. This should be complimented in what you do in real life, and on Linkedin. 

In the real world, your network speaks to who and how you can leverage people and resources to get shit done. It doesn?t translate real well to linkedin- but that?s the concept that these articles are trying to point out. That there is some intrinsic value to the numbers though is lost on me. Unless you are going to leverage it for monetization or advertising- no one gives a shit. No one will really hire you because of the number of followers you have or don?t have. The main thing to know is that after 500 connections on linkedin- they stop showing the exact number of connections on your profile and simply change to 500+. That?s neat, but it doesn?t speak to any level of quality of the connections, their activity, or anything. There are literally people that advertise themselves as accepting anyone that sends them a request. How is that a ?valuable? member of your network. Again, for you keep in mind your objectives. 

Start with institutions: for example, in your new country if you are in any type of educational institution, follow it and start connecting with people from there. Everyone loves a fellow student or alum.  

Start with companies that you would like to work at: Admittedly, this will have mixed results and probably a few people ghosting you. But that?s networking. You can look on the company page under people and search people that have similar job titles that you want. See if they will have a coffee with you or would be open to an informational interview about the company or what?s it like working in that field. Usually people can spare 15 minutes.

Try to find some groups: I?ve not found success with this but there are specific groups for ?new in town? or networking focused. See if they are doing any in person and virtual events. Meet some people and build that connection in real life, followed up by a connection request on LinkedIn.

"My Instagram account isn't showing up to anyone and nothing loads on my end. When I open the app sometimes nothing happens, and sometimes it says it's sending an sms code to confirm my identity. The code never comes. I haven't gotten an email or message of any kind from Instagram regarding the situation, and have no way of contacting support.

"I was just doing some digging trying to find some answers to some questions I have. I'm fairly ""new"" to Instagram, I've had a business account for my family's farm for years but only since about the middle of summer have really started focusing on driving social media engagement. On Instagram specifically I've been posting more, doing stories, reels, experimenting with hashtags, and generally trying to figure out the ins and outs of it for the first time. But over the past couple of weeks, my engagement has tanked. It was never that great on posts or stories, I'm guessing because I don't have many followers, normally I would get around 100-200 views. But I was getting several thousand views on each reel I posted. Now the last three reels I've done haven't even broke 200. My posts have also not been performing well either, struggling to get to 100. 

For awhile I thought maybe I was shadow banned, because the drop off was so sudden, but now I'm not so sure. I was digging around to see if I should switch from a business account to a creator account when I stumbled on your post. Glad to see I'm not the only one who has had a sudden drop in engagement. (Also any advice on the business vs creator account you have would be helpful) But it just is really annoying, I feel like I just started this project and am getting stopped before I actually get to get anywhere. I've spent quite a bit of time and thought on how to get our engagement up and it's just been getting worse.",Instagram

I asked a few of my friends if their Instagram showed the same thing, they said it didn't. So, I wasn't sure about submitting my video (I was scared). I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it to check if it was gone. It didn't, so I waited for some time. Later, when I opened my Instagram, all I could see was a black screen. I couldn't see anything else. 

I did a little research and found out that people who had submitted the video also faced the same issue.

I did everything to fix it, like:
1. Clear cache and data.
2. Uninstalled and Reinstalled it.
3. Logged in through chrome (it showed, "" Confirm your info on the app to get to your account. We noticed unusual activity from your account)
4. Logged in through other devices.

None of these worked. It has been 2 days since I have opened my Instagram.

"Has anyone else experienced a big drop in engagement since the outage?

In my quest to figure out the truth behind this, I've heard some random stuff like the 'new algorithm' means you should only use 15/30 hashtags to be seen better. Is there any truth to this? Where are people finding FACTUAL articles on how the algorithm is changing rather than some money-hungry marketer trying to make a quick $ off their IG course?",Instagram
"Hi all, last night I discovered I had been locked out of my account due to ""suspicious activity"" and the recovery code isn't in my email inbox or spam. Here's a summary of what happened and everything I've tried so far.

\-I discovered I was locked out of my account and requested a recovery code be sent to my email. There was no option to send it to my phone or another email account.

\-I realized I was completely out of storage on gmail and unable to send or receive messages, so understandably the code did not show up. I freed up a bunch of space and started receiving other emails again like normal.

\-The code still never showed up (in my inbox or in spam) after clicking ""send it again"" several times.

\-I went into my Facebook settings and set my email address as the default to send recovery codes to, based on another post I found in this sub.

\-I can't appeal a deactivated account through Instagram support because my account technically isn't inactive, I've just been logged out.

\-I tried clicking ""forgot password"" and entering my email, then my phone number, but both times I ended up being directed to the page where they told me I was temporarily locked out of the account.

Does anyone have an idea of what to do? I feel like I'm SOL. I can provide screenshots if helpful too. Thanks!",Instagram

"The ""Algorithm"" (there's multiple) uses image recognition and your description (key words) in the post more than hashtags. It decides what to show based on common interest and personal markers. For example, a selfie will get more engagement because that's 'personal'. Especially if your page isn't a full page of selfies. As for more engagement, it's pay to play. FB monetized the app long ago. Then, it shadow bans accounts starting at the 10k mark because microinfluencers are competition in their eyes. 

Now for paying to boost posts and such, they don't even have tutorials on how to maximize your reach by utilizing their own tools to reach a specific demographic.

"Does anyone know how to fix this? 

I have quite a few different story highlights on my profile. Some of them play music just fine. They will play each music snippet for every post in the highlight. But some posts will play until you get about half way through the highlight. Everything after that is stagnant. It loads the image but the music won?t play. You can?t even click on the music sticker for these occurrences to bring up the song tab. It?s as if the sticker isn?t there. This also wipes out almost every post after it. I think one ended up still playing. 

I had a business profile and had weird instances where it told me I can?t use certain songs. I?ve since went back to a personal profile. Ive had two posts on a story where it straight up told me that the specific music I chose is no longer available. This occurrence is fine, as the app is working fine and I?m sure there?s legal BS involved there. 

But with the music straight up not playing or the sticker not working and muting the remainder of the highlight as well as not even telling me the music isn?t available, I feel as if something technically wrong. I?ve tried updating the app, deleting and redownloding and switching personal.

I didn?t receive the pic in my inbox either. It was just shared in the audio call but my friend didn?t share it and he also wasn?t active on insta.",Instagram
"I had the exact same thing happen - I created a foot account of pics of my feet, no nudity or anything - just feet pics. After a week, it was deleted due to ""inappropriate content"" . I've appealed but no word back yet.

What's weird is I tried signing up for another account and it says the user name and email is already being used... yet IG is saying my accounts deleted. so I dunno what's going on.",Instagram

"I'm sorry to say this but I'm in the same situation and I couldn't find any solution. The account still exists, it's not deleted but there's no way to get in. Please, if you find a way to get in the account let me know...",Instagram

I'm facing a weird issue when posting long stories on IG, if the story is during more than 10 seconds, every part past the first one won't upload. I already tried to reinstall the app but without success, has anyone faced the same issue and is there any solution for this?",Instagram

"Hey r/Insgtagram **Help needed please**

I submitted a verification request through the app as our account has 115k+ followers now. Shortly after, we received a DM from an 'IG Portal' (unverified) account that said that the request had been approved and that we need to complete a form to finalize the process.

Stupidly, we provided our email/password & phone number, purely because the form pop-up appeared so legitimate. Almost immediately after we realized it was a scam and changed all related passwords etc.

I've now submitted 2 support requests via the app, but when I go into 'reports' > active reports - it says ""i haven't submitted any""

**What I'm looking for help with is**:

1. How can these scammers possibly know we sent a verification request when we never told anyone? Can they intercept the request or something?
2. Does anyone know why the support requests are not showing, and what's best to do about this?

Any help would be MUCH appreciated!!",Instagram
"Instagram never sends private messages. Ignore this message, nothing will happen. If you clicked the link, you should change your password as soon as possible. This is a phishing method to steal accounts.",Instagram
"If instagram really cared enough they would have made me add a phone number at the time I first created the account so that I wouldn't have to do this years later. But nope. You are locked out of the account and you better get a phone if you want it back. That's how life is ig. It's like being friends with someone online for years and then one day they block you for no reason. Nothing can be done to get them back.

"How do we combat something like this? 

I've been dating my girlfriend seriously for 9 months now. Ever since we've been together she's been getting random messages on instagram from fake accounts continuously stating how I am not who I say I am - that I've been talking to other women on the side - that I've been sneaking out from work to see another woman - basically attacking my character while stressing out my girlfriend. 

These messages have been occurring weekly - my girlfriend will read the message and then block the account. After a few days another message arrives from a new account, same type of deal. The weird and scary part is these messages can be oddly specific, whether it's where I'm supposedly having lunch with this unknown woman or where on date night me and my girlfriend have gone (despite neither of us posting anything anywhere), leading me to believe that either my phone or her phone has been hacked or being monitored but I'm not finding any evidence of such on my iPhone. This mystery person seems to know when I'm not home. 

I'd like to reiterate, I've been nothing but faithful to my girlfriend - have not been in communication with anyone besides my girlfriend, not flirting with anyone, not going on any secret rendezvous, etc. It's frustrating because we cannot even pinpoint who's doing these messages but they keep coming. Need some help / advice.",Instagram

"Few days ago instagram locked me out of my account and forced me to provide my phone number. I made a burner and put in the verification code, but it stayed stuck on ""we'll review your info and you might have access to your account in 24 hours"". still cant access it.

I made the previous one with my facebook account (also has no details) and had it since 2018, so I thought maybe making a new one with the phone number already in would prevent the phone number block. I used the same burner to make a new account and only days after, with no posts and little activity, it also blocked that one. wants phone numbe verification, used burner gave code. 24 hours later its still locked.

Talk about solving a problem nobody had. It literally makes the app completely unusable for me. I like to scroll to a position that makes it easiest for me to look at the thing I want to look at. I don't need the app deciding for me where I should stop scrolling.

My guess is that they are trying to make it so you scroll faster through posts and get more ad impressions, because from a UX/UI perspective this is a complete abomination. Since there is no known way to disable it, I'm going abandon the app completely. Hopefully if enough people do the same it will influence their A/B metrics and get them to either scrap the feature or make it easily toggled.",Instagram

Tried with my email and phone number- same exact error message. My friends looked up my account and it says ?User not found?, and my profile is completely blacked out with no posts or anything.

I only have ~350 followers, post a picture of my dog or family maybe once a month, rarely like posts, and only have been posting pictures of my recently suddenly deceased brother in my highlight reels memorializing his life. I have zero flags, no violations, and my profile is completely innocent.

I?m heartbroken and confused. I have so many memories on there, including conversations with my deceased brother that are seemingly lost forever now.

I?ve tried:

? Submitting the ?Instagram disabled my account? form where you send a pic/handwritten username

? Disconnecting completely from wifi in case Insta flagged me as some sort of bot

? Deleting/reinstalling the app 

? Logging in from my browser

? Hitting ?forgot password? (this does NOTHING because my account literally doesn?t exist at all)

? Essentially every other fix I?ve found online

Everything I try still ends with ?User not found? ?User doesn?t exist? ?No users found?. It?s fruitless.

The other day one of my post got banned and I couldn't make anything about it even if I tried to claim it back. I usually get a traffic of about 2M people on my account per week and suddently after the banned post everything stopped. No traffic, no new followers, almost no likes, I immediately thought I got Shadow banned but people I know told me they can still see my posts searching in the hashtag. I don't know what happend, I think I'm under some sort of ban but if it's not a shadow ban, I don't know what it is.

Someone with negative intentions could just send a follow request, you accept it, then they could get any information they want to get from your profile, whole time they have all the access to everything on your profile but you're still on pending, not being able to see anything from their account.

"I tried using only 5 hashtags on two posts after reading about this, so this wasn't an extensive test by any means, but yeah my reach was way down as well. 

People are speculating that the reason why the creator account is recommending only 3-5 hashtags is because people are using irrelevant hashtags when trying to use more (especially all 30) and it's ""confusing"" the algorithm. There are so many hashtags that are effectively useless in terms of searching for specific content because people will use them for literally anything.

"Background info: I have two IG accounts within the same niche, but both accounts have different content. There is some crossover between them but I use them both for different things. I used both my accounts for a reels experiment to see if I could make some sort of sense out of them. 

1) the same reel posted on both accounts might do really well on one account, and extremely poor on the other. For example, one reel had 30k views on one account, and 17 total on the other. Both were posted at the same time with similar hashtags and different captions - what would cause such a dramatic difference in exposure?

2) follower count seems to have no effect on reel views. The account with more followers will often do worse in terms of views, but that?s not always the case. 

3) reels with a lot of engagement from my followers will frequently not be shown to non-followers. I feel like that?s the opposite of what should happen. 

4) videos that go viral on other platforms barely get views on reels 

5) the past week in general has been shit for reel views. I assumed it had to do with IG being shut down for a day but neither of my accounts have recovered.

"If there were a good alternative, would you go there (talking to everyone reading)? We are ALL annoyed/at our end with IG, but here's the thing- there ARE other alternatives. Granted, nothing popular. There are other photo sharing apps where you can make profiles and post photos, but the problem is that no one is there. People say, ""I want an alternative!"" What they mean is, ""I want an alternative that all my friends are already on!"" And this doesn't yet exist. We would all have to actively work to CREATE a place and push all of our friends to go. I've been discussing making an app with a friend of mine just to give people a place where they can post, be seen, not be harassed with ads, etc. But I'm like.. this already exists. We are going to drop 80k into an app just for it to fail, all the while people continue to say, ""Gosh if only there were an alternative!"" We MAKE the alternative! The thing is that we have to get enough people together to agree to only go to ONE place, to build that place up so that there are people there! So it's not a dead app! I know many, MANY creators who have been disabled in the last few months, and my friend and I are also dealing with disabled pages/the same crap from IG. We are tired of it. But again, there are HUNDREDS of photo sharing apps. No sense in us creating another 'failed instagram alternative.' It's hard. The missing link here is unity. We need to have a place, one place where people converge to all agree, we are going to THIS app, and everyone go there and just choke instagram out. Only use instagram to promote this new app. 

This is what we need to do. It would have to be some sort of fixed site. We cant just make a reddit post that will be hot for 2 days and then get pushed down the feed and lose steam. Would have to be something available for a myriad of people to see, that will not get pushed down a feed and forgotten.",Instagram

">I feel like it?s completely random who gets on

It's not a singular place to be on or in. Everyone sees something different. There's no global Explore with identical contents that everyone sees.

>I see people on the explore page with 100 likes tops or with millions. I?ve seen people get on the explore page with either no hashtags or minimum, have a small following, and they are on it.

Because this is what Instagram has been trained to show you, by what you've told them you're interested in. You decided this through your activity on Instagram.

>However my posts usually get 1000 likes within a hour, my hashtags brings in like 1000 viewers and then my followers make up another thousand. Abs explore page views is like 50.

Cool. So Instagram showed your post to 50 people whose content preference match what you post. You seem annoyed by this.

>What can I do to make sure I get on every time?

That's not how it works. Nobody can be on one billion separate Explore pages for one billion Instagram users.

When I try to log into Facebook they show a message 'You disagreed with the decision, it usually takes just a day to review your information. Check back here.

"I downloaded Instagram in KZ(Which is originally Instagram in russian language) but I've decided that I want my Instagram to be in English since I got used to talk in that language and I just got bored of Russian language in general.

And for the past week, and this week, it was changing language by itself or mixing Russian and English language (e.g. when was last message sent in russian when open the chat in English).

"I just discovered this gem. 

Just got off chat with a lady who explained to me that she could proceed no further in helping me escalate my claim because my 'disabled instagram page was linked to facebook business account of which I had no role in."" Of course this confused the F out of me, and I'm like how on earth could MY Instagram be linked to a facebook business manager of which I have no access to? Here was her reply, verbatim. Hold on to your seats. I about fell out of mine. 

 ""I understand that you are not aware of this, however once you switch your account to professional after some time Instagram itself will create a business manager on auto for your Instagram. Hence why you are not aware about this, in most cases we will advice to connect the Instagram straight to an existing business manager of yours before Instagram creates its own which you will not have a role and also no access to it.""

... BEFORE INSTAGRAM CREATES ITS OWN WHICH YOU WILL NOT HAVE A ROLE IN AND ALSO NO ACCESS TO IT."" 

What the actual FFFFFFFFFF.

I have been on a cumulative 30 business chats in the last year trying to get help with the 2 disabled pages of mine. Received no help from the chats, but always got either the 'here's the appeal link,' or the few times someone actually 'escalated' the claim (you get a different reply with every person you talk to so you have to just keep trying), there was never, NEVER any help even with those few who actually seemed like they wanted to explain what was going on (like this lady did). Now I understand that most literally could NOT help me, nor did they take the time to help me understand that because my accounts were linked to the 'INSTAGRAM' business manager (of which I have no access to) and not MY OWN, they could not help me. So they just gave me the canned, ""Can't help, it's beyond our scope, here's the appeal link' instead of ever trying to explain to me, like this lady did.

BUT, if you do have an account set up with YOUR business manager, I do think you have a shot at actually being helped. Here is what she told me to do (and what you should do if you have an active instagram page so that if you get disabled you have a shot at getting your page back via chat). 

**FOR THOSE WHO WILL ASK IN THE COMMENTS- Set up a business page and run a 5-10 dollar ad for a few days, then your business support chat will enable. This is how you get access to the chat. I also assume this is the business manager you'll need to connect your instagram to.** 

Here's what she suggested I do once I get the page back (it won't work when the page is disabled, of course).

""Since you are not sure about the business manager that is connected to it:  1) You will need to convert your Instagram account to personal account again. This will ensure that the Instagram is disconnected from the business manager. 2) Once that is done, you can wait for few minutes then change the Instagram account back to business/professional account. 3) Immediately head",Instagram

"Hi there!

Long story short. Someone stole my picture and is using it as a profile picture. The picture includes me so someone is impersonating me. I think that the profile is actually a bot but I don't want to test my luck.

In order to avoid any trouble I reported the profile impersonating me. Instagram asked a picture of me holding my ID. I did send them one but they sent me a same (automatic?) response asking for a picture of me holding my ID. Before this I reported the profile from my account but the report was dismissed for not breaking the rules of Instagram.

I sent it again but if the case is not resolved what I can do? I provided them more proof of me having access to my profile such as joining date with a time stamp.

Any tips are welcome! I hope Instagram takes impersonating seriously and acts quickly to take down the fake profile.",Instagram

I was in the exact same situation  starting Friday I got locked out and everything disappeared I was panicking.  I sent the mug shots to confirm my identity and I was still stuck being logged out for three days telling me to say 24 hours. I got ignored by Facebook and Instagram and then on Sunday night I tried to login and it told me that my account was disabled for violating terms so I sent one last appeal saying that I was positive I didn?t violate them and that it was probably a mistake and then eight hours later they actually reactivated my account this morning and I was able to login!

"Its been a good 2 months since I touched the app. I mainly use it to log the sewing work I do but have done zilch since moving for a job back in August. I logged in and changed my password the other day after finally being able to get some sewing done and wanted to post progress pics. Things went fine. I wanted to post something this morning, but when I try to do anything, I get a message saying:

""Your account has been temporarily blocked from taking this action. Sharing your account with a service that helps you get more likes and follows goes against our Community Guidelines. This block will expire on 2021-10-15. Tell us if you think we have made a mistake.""

I only have 83 followers which are just people from school, work and sewing friends I have met through the years. Anything I post gets 5-10 likes tops. I am also not, nor have I ever paid for likes/follows as the message claims. This is just a place for me to document my personal sewing progress. My account is also completely private so only my followers (ie: friends and acquaintances) will see posts. I will also add that my Instagram is linked to Bumble which is a third party app. They required an Instagram to completely set up the account. If this is the problem, both companies SERIOUSLY need to be communicating on this subject. Bumble is not used to gain likes/follows. It is only adding the pictures on your profile.

Which of the dozens of algorithms are you talking about? There's not just one. There is no ""the algorithm"". And no, you can't do shit. Look how much people panicked and freaked the fuck out when Instagram was down for 7 hours the other day. People can't live without it and would never agree to an event or boycott.

I can't find any help on this issue or even a mention of the update. Googling it just shows old posts about the explore page doing this, or an old test for side scrolling. There's just one post on this subreddit that mentions the same issue, but it's from a year ago and nobody had a solution. 

It's so annoying, it gives me a headache to look at the screen when it snaps. I can't skip around posts, or navigate to where I want. It forces one post at a time by snapping them in place. Does anyone have a solution for this issue?

Edit - still unchanged after a few days, it's starting to seem permanent at this point. It's possible we're just part of a larger test group though. That's my hopes, and that they take the negative feedback into consideration. I hope their metadata shows that while it may increase ad viewership by a few seconds, that's it drastically reducing overall screen time.

It helps for a week or two which makes me feel like the algorithm only works to pull you in. And then disappears once they have you hooked again.",Instagram

"I use Instagram to share my photography, and I haven?t noticed any annoying advertising. I believe insta suggests accounts to you that are similar to what you?ve been liking. I like a lot of other photographers work and thus insta just shows me beautiful pictures all day and it?s actually quite pleasant. I don?t follow any trap accounts like people who post 1k photos of themselves in different outfits etc lol. It?s still a good platform for what I use it for.",Instagram
"So I have a minor issue with my notifications. I do receive them when someone sends me a text or something, but I have notifications turned on for some people (Like I want to see if they post stories or they post something) and I do not receive anything when they do something on their account.

For example, I follow one of my friends, whenever she post to her story I do not receive a notification. But when I open instagram I can watch it and see that she posted it about 5 minutes ago or something. 

Does anyone have this issue? Do you guys have any kind of solution? I tried reinstalling and other things but nothing seems to fix this.",Instagram
"Recently I've realized that Instagram on-app camera is automatically beautifying every picture you take, blurring backgrounds, skin, and more.

I don't believe this is happening just for me or is some setting on my phone because I've used the Instagram app on it for a while already and I just recently realized this ""feature"" (more like an issue to be honest.)Video example below.

Pay close attention to my hair before and after I take the picture and how it gets blurry. In the first picture, I am just comparing how the Instagram on-app camera takes the picture (left) versus my regular Camera app (right).

SOLUTION FOUND: After spending countless hours and trying a variety of software i have finally found a solution albeit you require to pay $30 USD for the software.  (https://drfone.wondershare.com).

Eventually print and save as pdf format and you have a specific chat history in pdf. 

Viber really need to bring the ability to be able to export or email chat history to yourself for cases like mine. Ill be looking to move away from Viber in the future for removing a feature that was once in place and should stay.",viber

"I will go crazy soon! I have been using Viber for years and it worked perfectly. Last month I went to travel to another country, I bought new SIM card and stick it into my phone. Everything OK. Then I bought a new phone (OPPO), stuck that local SIM into it and Viber worked still. After I got back home, I put my original SIM into this new OPPO phone and obviously that was too much for viber. Suddenly I can message everyone but half of the people cannot message me back! People also can't message me (except few of my existing contacts!). When my friend tries to send me a message, his Viber shows a message ""<my number> doesn't have Viber, would you like to send an invitation"". What a nonsense! I have Viber and I just sent that person a message!!!

See a screenshot from my friend's phone: http://imgur.com/a/TLtQV

I went to uninstall Viber from my phone, reinstalled it, did same on PC. Nothing helps. Still half of people cannot message me (and see this error) while half of people can message me.

Oh Viber you have a nasty bug... and I can't find a solution. Does someone here know how to solve this?",viber
What is the improvement? Why is there one every 2 days? I've been using Viber for years and I do exactly the same now as I did back then. Stop chewing up my limited bandwidth! f\*\*\* updates. Updates used to be actual upgrades. Actual improvement. Not constant silent changes.,viber

"I am in the exact same boat as you and have not been able to activate Viber on a desktop either.  I think Viber now treats Google Voice number not as a mobile number.  The bigger problem though is that I'm not sure if it's a Viber issue, or an overall problem where Google Voice isn't publishing their numbers as ""mobile"".",viber

I did it over the top of my 7.5 install and it didn't allow restore from cloud, but after deleting 7.5 then clean install of 7.4 it activated and allowed restore. I would try over the top of 7.5 if you're not jailbroken, as then your attachments should stay put. ",viber

"Hi, 

I think this is probably the best place to get an explanation or clarification of a thing that is kinda a problem for me. 

I am managing a niche Viber community. We had 5-6000 members when the thing we were promoting was ""hot"". Now it's not any more, and the number of members just keeps growing: 200-400 a day!

Most of them don't communicate in the group, probably don't even care what it's about. I'm guessing a large number of people also leave the group as soon as they realize they're in it. We have some spammers, of course, but we're quite diligent in removing those (think maybe a few dozen a day). 

Today, a guy asked to be removed from the group. I removed him, and then asked him privately why he joined if he didn't care about the topic (it's VERY clearly stated in the title of the group). He said he didn't, that he was ""automatically"" added to the group. 

Does anyone here know how and why thousands of people are being added to my group and why, and how to stop that from happening? 

Thank you in advance :)",viber

So **it's looking like I have no possible way to clean extra media data normal way,** it's just not working (that's viber: nothing works ok, will not tell sad stories), but anyway, may be you have any experiences or ideas?

I think it might be saving every video I send to someone after it encodes it? That's why I can forward them at a later time without reincoding it again or needing the source still on the phone (?).

How do I make space without losing the chat contents? Preferably, if I'm right, I'd like to only delete my sent encoded videos, and not chats, voice messages, thumbnails etc, and definitely nothing from the gallery. Thanks!

"End to end encryption isn't incompatible with the receiving end automatically grabbing thumbnails from URLs.

You just stick a bit of code in the app that looks for bits of the message formatted like a URL and then tries to grab an image. Only your phone and the URL host knows you received that URL and the URL host doesn't even know why your phone is querying them.

Arguably, sticking to the spirit of a properly encrypted messenger would mean this is an opt in feature but having it doesn't mean the messages aren't end to end encrypted.",viber

I checked the framerate and frametime with Rivatuner/Afterburner and it drops my fps from 144fps to between 3-29fps and the frametime is also chaotic.

I'm also curious about the solution!",viber

Viber version, I can still access and copy those files from same path, but they do not work. I cannot open them either on a phone or a PC. Files are copied correctly and have proper file size.

"So, I do not usually use Viber, but a lot of my friends in Europe do. I was traveling and decided to re-download. When I did I saw my new boyfriend?s either status or profile pic or something - a picture of another girl made into a meme with a love message on it. 
It was super weird. I was rushed and closed the app. The next time I opened it it disappeared and when I tried to text him from Viber it told me this phone was not on viber. The thing is, we never connected/communicated on Viber. What the heck did I see? I know the girl, so it is not somebody using his old number or anything.",viber
"Hello.

For some time now I am unable to answer incoming calls. Sometimes the phone just lights up, rings and vibrates but there is no possible way to answer the viber call, since there is no interface showing that this is viber that has a call incoming. Other times i see for a glimpse that someone is calling, but the ui disappears and again i cant do anything to answer or decline the call.

This is not always the case, but maybe 80% of the time. The other 20% works fine.

Tried reinstalling the app, clearing cache etc etc but nothing. Tried looking for a solution online, but can't find anything.

Any ideas why this is happening?

Thanks!",viber

When viber is running in the background, my PC sits at a constant 100fps. As soon as I select Viber, and bring it to the foreground, it drops to 30ish FPS and if I don't move the mouse, it settles at 2FPS.

Task manager isn't showing any increased loads coming from Viber, and my CPU and GPU are at <10% load.

What could be causing Viber to behave this way?",viber

"Hi there!  
I have to start off by saying I'm mostly satisfied with everything Viber offers for years now!  
But this is irking me for ages and it doesn't seem to get better ever:  


Any file or media I send via Viber (either on phone or PC) is at least 2-3 times slower than it should be. My upload speed is not great (\~100KB/s) , but Viber never seems to go over 50. I tested the same with my 4G connection and everything's fine, the speeds are consistent to how they should be.  
This has been the case for years and I've been hoping that it might change, but alas, it's still the same.

"Viber is very much ad-oriented. The best 'solution' is to use an app that really is just a messenger without any ad and tracking bloat, like Signal. Of course you may have contacts who only use Viber (as I do), so may not be able to completely leave Viber, but try to get some of your more willing friends and family to switch away from it.",viber
"A contact, let's name him Contact A, appeared on my new viber account saying Contact A has re-installed his viber, but this Contact A isnt saved on my new number to which that new viber is registered. Contact A was registered to my old viber with my old phone number on another phone. Both of these phone numbers are linked to 1 google account. The question is, did the contacts of both phone numbers sync because of a common google account, causing Contact A to appear on the new viber despite not having Contact A's number in my new phone?",viber
"I don't really use Viber anymore. I got it because some of my international contacts used it. Now it's much more common for us to use Messenger to communicate. I keep Viber for backup and because on one of my international trips I added $3.99 Viber Out credit, which I may eventually use...",viber
"hello,

has anyone faced this issue?

I've posted it to a couple of forums and found that there were a couple more incidents, 

anyway, I contacted their support and they gave me the following instructions to debug it:

"Yesterday was the Sinhala and Tamil new year. There was a Viber message with the ability to send stickers wishing Friends and Family. I clicked on this and selected my contacts to send greeting.

My account got blocked!

I contacted support who unblocked it but it got blocked again without me sending any messages or doing any things. The I got a message saying it is blocked again and unblocked again. The finally a message from the Viber support saying it is blocked again. I tried to send 2 test messages to my family which read ""hi"" and ""test"" some where during this time, but to one recipient only.

This is a relatively new number I got hence I want to get Viber unblocked on it as I want to start using this more. Also I don't see I have done anything wrong. The message I sent was the ticker they provided with contact I had in my address book also clicking on the ""send sticker"" button in the Viber message. There was no indication of how many greetings I could send, hence I selected my Viber contacts.

Many of my friends and family has also sent greeting to many common friends without issues. I am trying to figure out what might have gone wrong for this to happen:
- Since this is a new number I am not sure if the recipients all had this number saved. 
- Also some numbers in my contacts may be out dated and used by new users as cell companies recycle numbers.",viber
Okay I somehow managed to switch off sounds and just have the icon on the top left when I get a new message. But I can't find the option to disable the sound from when I receive a message while I'm in the conversation. Anyone knows how I can do that?,viber
"I want to use Viber only for (or at least receive notifications only for) messages from my contacts. However Viber (sender is ""Viber"") keeps spamming me unimportant messages such as about about new sticker releases at Viber Store, about  International Women's Day, about US Independence Day even though I do not care about anything like that. After all, I came to Viber for my contacts; if I wanted to be informed about who/what is going on out in the world, sure, I'd rather check a calendar or go read newspapers.

Tried to block ""Viber"" sender, but the application doesn't let me to do so. Any ideas?",viber

"Just a heads-up for this new setting which I found enabled by default in the app. It was announced in a privacy policy update [three months ago](https://www.viber.com/blog/2019-11-28/your-privacy-your-power-vibers-updated-privacy-policy/) but didn't actually appear in the app until an update this past week or so (at least for the Android version).

This name will soon become searchable by others on Viber, who once they have found you can start a chat with you. This chat hides both your phone numbers, and you can?t call each other.  
>  
>Privacy option: You can opt-out from letting others find you by name from your Viber Privacy Settings: More > Settings > Privacy > Find me by my name

>**In the spirit of making new people on Viber feel welcome, and help them make connections with people already on Viber, we may suggest people they may know to start chatting with.**

>Birthdays are fun and celebrating with friends is even more fun. To make it easier than ever for you to remember your friends? birthdays, Viber will soon notify you when it is someone?s birthday.

I sent some texts there and other member replayed and after ten minutes they are gone. Ok, I got that. But my question is this: are they destroying ten minutes after someone clicks on text that I sent and actually reads them or ten minutes in general like I send now no one replies, they disappear. Or If one person reads them a day after, they have 10 minutes to read. Like does it work like that. Is it counting from the time you clicked on them?

"Hello there!

I've been having a recurrent issue where, after downloading photos to my phone and moving them from the default ""Viber"" folder to another location (local storage or SD card doesn't make a difference), the option to ""save to gallery"" disappears from the Viber conversation, and opening the photo within Viber just shows a black screen and a ""File not found."" error message.

I did not select any option to remove the photo from the Viber conversation; I only moved my own personal copy, saved locally on my device. That shouldn't nake a difference, and in fact restoring the photos to Viber's default location doesn't solve the issue.

tl;dr Viber photos and ""save to gallery"" option disappear after transferring locally-saved copy. I want to view the photo again from within the conversation but Viber will no longer let me. 

Any help to fix this issue is appreciated. Thank you!",viber

"Hello fellow redditors,

&#x200B;

So I use a chromebook as my daily driver the last 6 months. At some point I needed to install viber. So given that there is no viber app on chrome webstore, I downloaded the android version. I encountered many issues with this app, from crashing to not being able to hear people on the "" other side of the line "" with both ears. So, I ended up uninstalling and reinstallin the app multiple times, till I decided to send a message to Viber support team. They promptly responded saying that Viber has cut the support for ChromeOS machines. So long story short, I have a malfunctioning app that the leading company in smartphone communication does not support for any ""bugs"". 

I am realy troubled about this issue, there are millions of ppl out there using chromebooks, and the majority of them are using viber as a means of communication.

Honestly, why Viber do you abandon all these ppl???

When I try to start it it just quits instantly, like for a millisecond you can see the window and then it just crashes.

"This is a problem for what I have been in touch with Viber support, without any improvement yet. If anyone had the same, pls refer to us what you did to solve it.

So, what's the problem?

Since about a month ago, there is a substantial lag between the time I send a message to one  specific contact and the time that my contact receives it.  The problem is apparent to the other way also, as this specific contact  sees the same lag when she sends a message specifically to me. Both she and me see this lag only when we send from one to the other of us and only in our android devices. The lag  duration depends on the time of the day. In evenings gets even over 30  seconds, while in mornings it is like 5-10 seconds. 

The messaging from Windows PC is instant. Also, I have test it and the lag is the same either with WiFi or mobile data (4G specifically); while the instant messaging with other apps we use (facebook messenger) is completely smooth.

I have to note that our chat history (between the two of us) is substantial. It may be the problem's origin, but we don't wish to delete it. 

I have progressively, in both android devices, cleared cache, cleared  data, and reinstalled the Viber app, without any improvement. We were, also, advised to block and then unblock each other or to delete each other's contact. Both solutions did not bring any improvement.",viber
"I'm relatively new to Viber, so i apologize if this is a known issue.

is there any way *for me* to combine these 2 conversations into 1?",viber

"Hi! I have a similar story. I used Viber phone number account **without phone** only by PC for several years for sending **messages only**. The sim card for this number was lost by me and I forgot about it at all.

About **two months ago**  my account at PC was blocked.   It turned out that **someone bought my number** from the number's mobile operator. Thus I see that **mobile operators sell your old numbers** if you **don't use them for calls** for a long time and not make payment for its.

Now **my contacts** from my former number know nothing about the mutter. They starts write messages to me through Viber but in fact they write to another person and **do not know that it is not me**.

The **new owner** of the number, when **she**(woman!) receives these messages from them, begins to joke and mislead them in  return messages.

I have bought **a sim card with new number** (similar to the old one) and wanted to **transfer my old contacts** to the new number from my  PC(Linux).

**The Viber technical support service refused** to help me. They said it is impossible. Then I read this **article** [Export contacts from Viber PC version](https://superuser.com/questions/865449/retrieve-export-contacts-from-viber-pc-version) .

**Thanks to it**, I **retrieved** my old numbers (about a thousand ones) from my PC in a file.  Now I put these numbers into my new Viber account **with my hands  through my new Viber account on PC**. I am sending to my former contacts similar messages **that my number was changed**(copy-paste ?nd  only Names are different).

But **the Viber's anti-spam system** perceives my attempts to connect with these contacts as spam messages and **I have several times  for my new  account blocked**  from the Viber now. I have stopped my activity **after sending 300 messages for my ex contact numbers**. By the way after several blocking **the Viber can block your account forever**.

I wrote **several letters to Viber's technical support service**, but they unsubscribed to me that **everything is working okay** and fell silent.",viber

"is there a way to prevent desktop viber from notifying me about incoming calls? I don't have, nor do I want to have a microphone on my pc, I use it to work, and dialogue allowing me to take a call I can't take, covering my current work for no reason is useless and obnoxious. you can't even minimize it away, you have to sit and wait until the caller gives up.

looking at settings, it seems you can turn off notifications for messages, which I prefer to receive on pc where it's easier to type, but you can't turn off calls which are bothersome and as far as I'm concerned don't belong on pc anyway.

so i'm looking for a hack or anything that would prevent viber from jumping at me while I'm doing something else. I swear, it keeps insisting on updates, it won't close entirely, you have to close it twice, once on x and once from tray, and it won't let you turn the calls off. as much as I like typing on my pc, if I can't get rid of these features, I'll just have to never use it",viber
"After using almost exclusively Viber for the last two years and after more than 200k messages exchanged I switched to Signal and urged my contacts to do the same. So far, so good.

The reason is that Viber killed secret chats where you couldn't screenshot messages and save media. (On iOS you can screenshot, but the other party gets notified). Besides, when I backed up my old phone and restored everything on my new phone I noticed that lots of Viber pictures were missing, especially the pictures that I sent, in both regular and secret chats. Lots of the rest were there but no gallery thumbnail preview was available. In system preview Viber takes 5GB of data space. In backup it's just 2GB.

Backup in Viber doesn't work anymore. The compression is slow, it takes days to get to 30%, and then restarts from 0. 
Voice calling is also bad in quality and it drops mid conversation without a reason.

Not reliable anymore.",viber

"One feature that has been springing up in various VOIP apps is low data calling mode. Whatsapp can decrease the data consumption from 310 KBpm to 204 KBpm by switching on this mode. A similar less-known app Zangi prides itself on 216 KBpm and 134 KBpm on low data mode.  Although viber is quoted at the low rate of 240 KBpm, I think it would be nice to have an even lower data rate option which would increasingly improve quality in poor cellular coverage, congested, high ping-time environments including driving in a car. Thoughts?

Edit. The following website and chart argues that Viber uses even more than WhatsApp. Viber what are you doing?

I'm using Viber for a long time without any major issues, but not I have a first world problem: the ""is typing"" bubble isn't there when someone is texting me. The message just appear without any signs that the person was typing.

"The fact that it allows one to backup their messages history in Google servers. The problem is, it is not encrypted.

Irony is, Viber cannot see our messages, but they will happily let Google see them.

You may as well just disable it, fair option but how can you be sure the other person is not sending all of your texts to Google? Its worse because you think your communications are safe while infact it is not because the other person you are talking to has unencrypted backups to Google enabled.

Well, you are an average joe who uses Viber because of it's superior(I... mean superior to Facebook Messenger) video and audio calls and the fact that your photos are not degraded when it is sent over Viber. But can you see this sorta ""Ooh Viber is the most secure thing in the planet because noone other than the other people you are talking to can see your messages"" being a little bit misleading?

Is this the end? Should we stop trusting Viber? I think we should rather try to ask the people behind Viber to encrypt the message backups created by Viber. It wouldnt be hard thing to implement. And while we are at the backup section, maby ask them to allow us to locally backup our messages in our phone(encrypted) that we can manually move around and backup to cloud service providers of our choice rather than just Google?",viber

"Hi all. I've been freeing up space on my phone by uploading all of the photos of my pets into an album on my personal Facebook page. Finally, after everything being SUPER out of order, I've started to edit the date on the photos. I understand that this will reorder the posts within my timeline, but I want everything to show in chronological order within the album as well. As by this point I have 5.5 years of pet photos to go through (and well over 1,000 photos already uploaded), using the ""drag and drop"" option to reorder things is COMPLETELY out of the question, as that would take weeks. I know I've got some doubles (and even triples, because sometimes I took screenshots of the photos), and I'd like everything to be in chronological order so I can easily delete these duplicates.

So far the only way I can find to edit the album is to drag and drop. Any one remember being able to chronologically order their photos (we were able to do it, I don't know, like 3-4 FB updates ago?), or how to bypass and make this happen without the drag and drop?

Big thanks for any help! (The photos attached are the only options I have when trying to edit an album)

\*\*Edited to add\*\* switching over to feed view only changes the look of the layout from grid to posts for \*me\*, and doesn't do anything about the date of the photos, only when I uploaded them as a batch (I upload anywhere from 2-40 at a time)

They banned me permanently after I stopped liking things, unfollowed nearly everything, clicked the options to never show pages from suggested content or things my ""friends"" commented on, blocked all their trackers, and used Firefox to isolate facebook.com.  I also uninstalled their app from my phone years ago.  If I needed to access Facebook on my phone, I used Brave.  I basically blocked every opportunity for them to get information on me and they permanently banned me after a few months with an accusation of faking something in my profile.  They accused me of violating section 3.1 of the ToS which I never did.  They asked for an ID to verify my name so I sent them my Japanese residency card which is a government issued ID and on their list of approved IDs.  That was in August and I haven't heard anything from them since.  I wouldn't be upset if it were not for the fact that I now no longer have some baby pictures of my kids (my account was 14 years old...lots of memories), I've lost contact with a lot of the people I served in the military with, and I can't even use Messenger.  I never interacted with public content and never posted anything controversial so I had no fear that I would some day get banned, but here I am with a permanently disabled account with a false accusation of faking something in my profile and their support won't even respond to emails after the initial response where they asked for ID.",Facebook

Anyone that disagrees or takes something out of context only has to hit the report button and you're automatically banned.

It should be given to people that have experience in dealing with this kind of imagery.  
A good example would be people that were studying for becoming a doctor but dropped out for another reason, so they are used to seeing bodies without being affected by it.  


OR at the very least they should put the person through a DEMO of what they will usually see and what they should do, and test how they react to it. I mean, in some countries even cops have little classrooms sessions where an experienced guy shows slides of horrible situations and how he deals with them.

Sure, for example , anti vaxers are dangerous. The solution? argue and reason and argue some more until you have convinced them. Dont give them a victim complex...

I recognize they are a private corporation, and can do as they please. But surely we should all be arguing AGAINST censorship.  


Disagreement with the correct ideas will always be dangerous, non-optimal, annoying. But surely the process of discussion is the best pathway to understanding what is correct.

I changed password but hacker email still associated and 2fa code sent there. Communicated w/reporters who wrote stories and successfully contacted FB to recover account of subject of their stories. But, in response to me it was, ""so sorry to hear this happened to you..."". NPR reporter included disclaimer that FB funds NPR. Their article subject had the same concerns as I, except for the additional photos of my deceased father, aunts, and old friends that I wanted to recover.  
Had a few notifications of posts despite not being able to access my account. Later, got a notice of groups being deleted, but not why and by whom. 
I keep sending identification and explanations of issues but no followup.

Has anybody experienced the same thing?",Facebook
"My original 14 year old account got fully disabled due to somebody gaining access and misusing the account.

I was unable to request a review or download any of my data. Facebook did absolutely nothing to assist and didn't offer any support at all even though I followed all the process to recover the account.

Absolutely useless. I wouldn't trust them to do anything with security. Thanks to that I lost 14 years of memories, friends and pictures.

"I pity the poor Trump losers who continue to cling to their conspiracy theories, their weird anti-science beliefs and their meth and fentanyl.

They are generally less educated and successful and they yearn for an era when fags were in closet, children were to be seen and not heard and women deferred to their husbands.

They are anti-intellectual in a world increasingly dominated by a technocratic elite and an immigrant one at that.

They are emasculated at every turn and have lost every culture war. It?s no wonder they are so angry at being impotent and unable to understand the changes in the world.",Facebook

I had the same problem. If you're uploading photos via the computer you have to sort the folder that you're adding the photos from by data and then it will add them in that order. I'm not sure how to help if you're uploading from a phone... You could use dropbox to send all your photos to your comp and then upload them from there? It's extra steps but it's just the loading time.... you don't have to manually watch it :),Facebook

"Novi, a digital wallet from Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) that is designed for assisting with digital payments and storing cryptocurrency, is ready to come to market, according to a medium post on Wednesday from the tech giant?s financial executive David A. Marcus.

FinePrint: Marcus writes that Facebook deserves ?a fair shot,? to join the digital payments space, pointing out that the company has enabled over $100 million in digital payments during the last four quarters.

History: After Facebook?s first entrance in crypto with the currency Libra failed due to massive pushback, the company switched focus to a watered-down plan featuring stablecoins and blockchain payment system Diem. The digital coin is slated to launch later this year.

Stock Watch: Facebook stock slipped 0.84% on Wednesday. It was a mixed day for crypto prices as well.

Final Thoughts: For Facebook, there are some questions about how it expects to profit from crypto. But for the crypto world, Facebook?s entrance adds some much-needed legitimacy to the space.

Mine was hacked back in June and I tried to get appealed a few times but now it says my account doesn't exist at all. I tried making a new account but it wouldn't let me. When I created a completely new email account to use my FB got banned immediately. I don't know if it was an IP ban but I got an email saying that I violated the guidelines somehow.,Facebook
I was able to submit an ID but i got an email saying that the information does not match one on file.  The first name is spelled a bit differently than the name on the Facebook account but i have no other ID that has the same name as on the FB account. The birthday and last name is the same. Am i just out of luck if i have no ID with the exact matching name?,Facebook
"I am writing here as a last desperate act from Facebook inability to secure my account.

Hello everyone, This is my first time posting here so apologies in advance of any mistake that I may have made.

I have my Facebook account linked to my Business Accounts. I mainly runs my Facebook ads for a company. However, it was hacked and I want to share my experience with you guys as a case study incase anyone else got the same problem with me in the future.

Hacker added themselves as ""partners"" on my Business Accounts and change ads content of my running ads to their own. My credit card was charged 10000$++.I tried contact Facebook in their chat box multiple times but all they all can do is let me wait. After few days, Facebook support team finally reach out to me and have a phone call with an actual human being. The day after that, I got an email with the following messages

"" The situation you have experienced with the compromised account should not happen again as our team has secured the account.""

"" However, I am unable to share the information about how this had taken place as the investigation is done by the team in the back-end and we have no direct contact with them. They are not disclosing the investigation procedures and methodologies for security reasons.""

They basically told me that I should trust them that my account is secured with no explanation of how that hacker got in and no explanation on any other matter.

2 days after the email, hacker have access to my account again and added themselves as partners on my business account again. I contact the team again that hackers still have access to my account.

I have 2factor authentication on my phone, signed out of all devices on Facebook and Google account after the issue. Still, hackers can access my account.

I did multiple virus scan with Window security to ensure that my laptop is cleaned.

Anyone with any information please help me. I really don't know what to do. My jobs is to runs ads and Facebook can't ensure that I can run it safely.",Facebook
"They've been doxing business accounts that are perfectly professional, if it's any consolation. What are they collecting all of this information for (with a false promise of unlocking, unsuspending, allowing advertising spend)?",Facebook

"Thoroughly confused about what to do next. She was trying to get her access back and kept getting nowhere. She could change her password and it would prompt her to get an SMS message sent to her phone to verify, but then it wouldn't give her any place to put the code. In frustration, she created another account with the same phone number, which somehow worked. But it's a totally new account and her old business account page isn't linked to it at all. To top it off, her business account is still visible, but she doesn't have access to it now. 

This is crazy. How can there literally be no way to contact FB for help on these issues?? Anyone have any ideas?",Facebook
"Dear OP, there's no way for you to know the reason.

Facebook does not tell people the reason because they don't want bad actors to find loopholes. That's what they told me.

So even if you know their stupid bot is wrong and your conscience is clear, you will never know the reason and even if you pay them millions of dollars in advertising revenue, they don't care.

Therefore, people, dump Facebook.

"It seems like anytime I come off a ban now I'm back in FB jail within a couple days for innocuous posts which contain verbs which are construed as threats.  I appealed the first couple just because I had the time, but I no longer have the time or energy to mess with it so I've just gone ahead and made a new account.  

We'll see how long it takes the new account to acquire the black spot and have to have every post screened.  I've been on the platform for over a decade now and I have some pretty solid memories tied to my old account.  It's some BS what they're doing on the platform, but also no clue how you'd stop it.  FB users essentially have 0 rights on the platform.",Facebook

"Confused about this subs rules... It does say it's ""A sub for news about the social media site Facebook.""  but if you like or share you are banned? Huh?  I guess they mean within facebook? Just to follow up on this, the Washington post has an article today about this  stating Facebook has now released a report that said ""an article raising concerns that the coronavirus vaccine could lead to death was the top performing link in the United States on its platform from January through March of this year, acknowledging the widespread reach of such material for the first time."" So they waited 3 months cause they were getting alot of traffic thus ad revenue?    So looks like back in July when President Biden accused platforms like Facebook of ?killing people? for spreading misinformation about covid-19, while the Surgeon General called such misinformation an ?urgent threat.?  they were 100% correct. Making money by spreading the seeds of doubt to millions of people.

"Hey I had the same problem for two months! They locked me out- I kept verifying it was me and after a while I didn't even get the email notifications (that didn't work btw) to 'unlock' my facebook page. It would send me a link that just sent me back to a locked fb page and no ability to access. I left it for a few weeks because it was two months of consistent verification, I would email back the case managers who sent me the email and after they sent me another dud link they just wouldn't respond... I filled put all the forms like 5 times each... changed the passwords, did all the things.
Then yesterday I decided to give it another crack just for fun and for some reason they changed the verification method to 'name your friends' and I had to name like 5 people from my friendship group. All of a sudden I got access back immediately. I don't know how but if you keep going you might get a different verification method.

I also made sure to opt out of them keeping my verification for more than 30 days, but kept sending in the same one. Maybe it's my tin foil hat but I'm a little convinced because I gave them bare minimum for two months they weren't going to get anything more, they just changed the verification method to collecting data on others haha.",Facebook

Like they have no way of knowing what's going on with their friends or the world today. It's an odd feeling... On one hand it's refreshing, but I really can't wait to get back on Facebook.",Facebook

"hi!

Recently this happened to me and it's really bugging me out. My facebook friend went offline at around 5PM. I had something to say around 11PM, and so I sent it. However, the message was seen by my friend at 2AM, even though when I checked their active status it said ""Active 7 Hours Ago"" (which is correct, since they logged out at 5PM). 

I have had this problem for a while now, both in desktop and in mobile. However, it is much more rampant in the facebook messenger app.

I was wondering if this was some sort of bug. 

Thanks!",Facebook
"I have never seen this feature before, it just popped up today saying I had a notification on the top left on my profile on the messenger app. This area called ?switch user? showed a notification so clicked on it and it has a mans name I didn?t recognise. I clicked on it, it took me to read his messages. 
They do not seem to be spam, seems a normal person chatting to his friends. 
In ?switch user? I swiped left and removed the profile but it remained and only showed as ?signed out? 
However I can click on it again and it doesn?t ask for a password or any other information for me to access his messages again
I have reset my facebook password, deleted the app, restarted my phone, redownloaded the messenger app and it still appears
I have done the ?log out of all devices? option on Facebook on a laptop, it made me input my password but I still have access to the gentleman?s account under switch user
There is no activity on other devices that are not mine so I assume he has not yet discovered that he has access to view my messages
Please help, I cannot find anything remotely similar online anywhere 
I have submitted an issue to Facebook but doubt I will receive a reply any time soon
Thank you",Facebook

Finally after 7 days of no facebook a new phone, new service, same phone number, 20 calls to spectrum,  2 dreams about phone problems later I woke up and  grabbed my laptop made a new Facebook account with a different email. Added my phone number to that account. I went under settings then clicked on mobile and added my phone number had them call me instead of texting just incase I wouldn't get sms again. They called gave me the code. So I then logged into my old account.  Everything works now. It's been so annoying. I thought it was spectrum or my sim card or a port problem.  Cause I definitely went in to every phone setting to make sure nothing was blocked. Hope this helps someone.  I've been frantic trying to figure this out. Facebook has my job and customers on there.

"UPDATE I GOT MY ACCOUNT BACK.... A hacker took control on my facebook account a week or so ago. I followed the process and uploaded my ID. Facebook sent me an email with a link. Using the link I got to a 2-factor screen which the hacker enabled. I had to researched what to do next and the next day tried again and the link no longer allows me in. I wonder if the hacked change the password and the link will no longer work, or is this something else. Link they sent me seems to just take me to the main screen and has me try log in, and wants to send a password change to the hacker's email. The link expires 8/31? Any ideas?

UPDATE 9/8/21- after following the Facebook hacked link, that appeared to disabled my account from others and within a few days I got the first email. This first request did require me to upload an image of my drivers license. The return email came with a link and temp password. This email got me through the first password reset but stopped me at the 2 factor that the hacker enabled. After many tries with no success, eventually the link expired. Trying to login again I got another request to upload my ID, this time the email back include a link to bypass 2-factor and that time it worked.  I did have to upload my ID again. The hacker added friends and a credit card to my account which I deleted and then enable my own two factor. ",Facebook
"I woke up to find that I was hacked and they posted something that got me banned.

Aug 29. 2:47 AM. My account was banned for posting something that didn't follow community standards. (I love that the warning says I can't advertise for 30 days here too...)

Sept 6. Fearful that payments from the ads in our games would not go to us, we disabled our Facebook SDK within our mobile games. Note, we have several ad generating revenue streams within our game, FB just isn't getting paid anymore.

Sept 9. I tried the dispute option and had to upload my ID several times over several days, on the 9th it has not changed from this screen.

Sept 14. Paypal payments started going to paypal to pay for ads!? I disabled the paypal link to facebook before it got out of hand. I reported the nearly $90 spent, but paypal said they would not refund it because it was previously setup with the merchant. That email said they canceled the agreement too, but I already did that before I sent the dispute...

While it sucks I've lost about 10 years of family photos. You would think the lost of revenue to Facebook would get someones attention at Facebook because our game has over 10M downloads. You'd think I'd be able to contact someone, but even when I try to go to the developer login area it blocks me out.",Facebook

"A family member of mine had a few facebook accounts made a LONG LONG time ago, back when facebook wasn't as strict on how you can make them. She had certain things posted on the account that are irreplaceable, and unable to be found anywhere else. We found out that almost all of those accounts have now been locked, giving this message:

**Your Account Has Been Locked**

**We saw unusual activity on your account. This may mean that someone has used your account without your knowledge.**

**To protect you, your profile is not visible to people on Facebook and you can't use your account.**

From what I've researched, getting an account back in this case, could require giving proof of who you are, among other things (potentially a government ID or something of that sort). Besides the fact that there are concerns between us about doing so, a lot of these accounts are all ""fake"". As in, have names/profile images based off of famous characters, rather than real people. We're worried that trying to get the account unlocked is going to lead them to take a closer look at them, and delete them. 

We don't care about keeping the accounts, they've been inactive for years, we just want to be able to save the things that are on them. Does anyone have any suggestions? Being able to make the recovery as simple as possible would be a blessing. Thanks in advance.",Facebook

"Same thing happened to me on 7/10.  After trying all of the helpful tips many times, sadly they didn't work for me.  I did get one reply recently when I tried to use a new email and submit my ID... but even though the picture on the ID is clearly the same as the picture on my account, I use a nickname on Facebook not my legal name... so they said it didn't match.  I am quite certain that was just a bot response.  I even one time got to the spot where I could identify friends as part of the verification process, but when I got to the part to change my password, I could not.  

There are only a couple of features on Facebook that I miss, so I don't really want to create a new account.  Plus, any new account I create is going to be suspect because I'll have zero friends, so the things I want to join won't want to add me.  Also, the complete lack of professional accountability on the part of Facebook just makes me want to be done with that platform.  They know this is happening and they refuse to create any type of customer service.  I'd love to see the main stream media cover this story, but I've seen nothing but a couple of small stories.  Nothing that suggests the magnitude of the problem.",Facebook
"I cant remember exactly, my account is locked but i did manage to change my password after i was hacked. I couldn't get into facebook either. I believe I got the code by having it sent to the email open on my phone. It gave me the option to send it to 2 emails, my email and the hackers, or have it sent to the email open on my phone so of course I didn't want it sent to me and the hacker. Before this I had to have my account locked though, submitted my ID (before the outage), changed my password, and added another email when they asked for ID. I can now log in but my account is locked again, which I think has something to do with timing and the outage. Even though I couldnt access the code generator from my facebook, I got a pop up notification where I could get to the generator. I hope that makes sense.",Facebook

"yeah, I have my own story too. Just screw fb. I had 2 accs on fb, 1 for personal and 1 for work, as fb mandate us to give them credit cards details and phone no. so I wanna play it save as I was managing a few of my client accs too back then. Also because I want to have 2 set of network, personal and work. I access both acc on the same device.  


So here's the thing, when my personal acc got restricted, the other work acc got the same restriction. Fb actually traced my details to that extent, my ip address. I realize the risk of it so I reduce my reliance on fb, ig and whatsapp ever since and gradually stop using them anymore.  


As for how I got restricted, there were an argument back then, the other person, being a dick, used racial slur and some other mockery that involves religion. Out of impulse, I called him names. I was aware of the policy because I got it before, when we used to poke fun and grill each other.  


Usually, there's a warning on the first time and will only gt restricted if you do it again.   


I should've stopped if I got the first warning, so serve me right right? But here's the thing. There's no warning notification on the first time, then suddenly 3 notifications came in at the same time and that made 3 strike and I got restricted for few days. And out of that 3 comment that triggered the warning, only the 1st and 3rd got sensitive word in it, the 2nd 1 did not contain any sensitive words, it just contain a few same words as the 1st and 3rd. Example:  
1st: You're stupid  
2nd: This is a Dog  
3rd: A stupid Dog  


Fb will take those 3 comments as 3 different comment and gives 3 warning, boom, strike 3 and out you go.

"Big tobacco saves lives. Facebook destroys them. 

We all must work together and write our congressman and ask for Facebook to get ripped apart. They have shown NO concern for humanity. They block the silliest shit.

I've never seen such ineptitude. When you hire fifty thousand dorks to reinvent the wheel I mean this is the nonsense that we have to deal with. We can't get support and they randomly block people for NO fucking reason. 

The answer is NOT more censorship. The answer is for Facebook to be disassembled into three tiers (WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook . Shit their business app should be a fourth company. And then each tier gets broken up at the STATE level.

Yesterday morning my FB account PW, email, and phone number was changed. I've reported the account as compromised, but it felt pretty empty/pointless.

Also, I can't locate my account at all. Does anyone else have experience with why it suddenly disappeared? I did find a second ""Verify your ID with fb"" that asked for some more demographic info, but that link didn't work either. I've been unable to figure out how to ask for security questions. It seems FB only knows how to approach this issue one way: log into account, don't know the recently changed PW, recovery email isnt mine, then that's it. I can't process any further.

I also tried to bypass the 2FA, but when I click for ""need other options"" there isn't a button to ""submit info to FB""

"This happened to me as well last month.  I'll be honest ... Facebook is useless when it comes to it's free customers (regular profile).  Unless you have a business account or an Oculus account you're out of luck.  I've read people who have been waiting for 6 months for FB to contact them even after submitting their proof of ID with no luck and you have 1 year to log back in before FB purges inactive accounts.  I submitted my PASSPORT and got a response back from FB ... and here is a direct quote ...

""Thank you for submitting your ID"" <--- Email title

""We can?t give you access to this account or help with your request until we receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account ..."" <--- Email text

My passport had my name exactly how my profile said it and had a clear photo of me, a passport is also on the list of accepted forms of ID which is listed in the link FB send in their email.

So I lucked out and went the Oculus route since I have an account and VR set already.  Got access to my FB account in 6 days.  Had it not been for the Oculus workaround I probably would have never gotten my account back.  That being said, even if you try the Oculus workaround you're not going to find an Oculus set right now at any store.  They have a recall on the VR set over the facial interface (the part that touches your face) and they pulled all devices off of the shelves until they make new facial interface parts and replace all models.  Then they'll put them back out for sale.  And I'm assuming that because they are recalling all purchased devices they will be replacing those interfaces/devices first before they put new devices out for sale.  So if you decide to go the Oculus route it does work ... you might just have to wait a couple of months.",Facebook

UPDATE: ACCOUNT UNLOCKED!!
Okay everyone, there?s hope, here?s how I unlocked my account:
I went through the app to log into my hacked account (computer browser does not work for this step) and of course it asks for the 2FA code which is linked to the hacker. But then click on ?I don?t have my phone? then ?contact us?. Then it gives you the option to put in an email, put an email NOT ASSOCIATED with your Facebook account and upload your ID photo. Facebook rejected my perfectly fine driver?s license every time, so I finally uploaded my passport photo to verify my account. The next day I got the email with the link. DON?T click on the link, instead copy the temporary password they?re giving you and log in with that. That temporary password code is gold, it will log you into your account (you may need to go through identifying your FB friends) and you?ll be able to change all your setting, passwords and set up your new 2FA with your phone number. This really works!!! Got my account back after a week of hell loop with Facebook.",Facebook

"I'm currently in the ""too many codes"" limbo. I submitted my ID and that was approved, so now my own email is a recovery address in addition to the the hacker's ??.

But I want to share that the part about different platforms having different options totally seems to be true.

For instance, I *only* received the option to submit my ID from the the mobile app, not my pc.

Currently, on my pc which is running chrome (and logged in to my Google account) one of my password reset options is to ""use my Google account: log in to Google to quickly reset your password"". This choice didn't appear until I got my email put back on, and my email is Gmail, so I think that's related. Anyway, all it seems to do is automate putting in the the code so I don't have to go check my email. The bad part is it doesn't bypass the ""too many codes"" thing. What I'm hoping it will do though, is keep the code from also being sent to the hacker's email, since I suspect that is the reason why apparently so many codes were entered. But who knows. 

And I only sometimes got the put in your old password option. 

Basically, try different platforms and browsers, see if you get different options. 

But I'm disheartened to hear I will still have to fight through the 2-factor authentication that the hacker put on if I even ever make it through this step.",Facebook

"The Birdhouse Effect.

The Birdhouse effect is an analogy to the life cycle and business model of these large data collecting tech firms.

Let's imagine for example you start out with a sincere idea to make tiny wooden birdhouses because altruistically you see a need to shelter helpless little city birds.

As time goes on the birds get addicted to the warmth, comfort, and comradery that your tiny houses provide. They tell more birds. And those birds tell other birds.  Soon your tiny houses are the most popular resting place for tiny city birds.

You're elated that your benevolence is making a difference.

Then one day, by chance, you realize if you put a trap inside the tiny wooden houses you can collect the birds and sell them to a snake farmer for a profit.

Selfishness and greed have warped your character and changed your purpose in life. The tiny wooden houses now become secondary and just a vehicle and attractant for the trap. The traps are your real purpose now.

Unless things change, and birds stop coming to your tiny wooden houses, unlikely because they're so addicted to your clever ""architecture"", you see no reason to stop putting traps in the houses and making more profit.

I'm a musician, and I frequently want to promote shows I'm playing by tagging the venue or organisation I'm working with in my posts.

My posts almost NEVER show up on those community/public posts and so I miss out on a big potential audience.  I always type @ and then select the correct page from the dropdown.  I've also tried checking in to the venues, but that doesn't seem to help either.  The posts are always set to Public, by the way.  
There have been one or two cases in the past where the tagging *did* work, and the reach for those posts went through the roof as you'd expect.  I can't figure out why this is the exception though, rather than the rule.

"I think facebook is highly dangerous to everyone. 

Their algorithm is designed to create echo chambers, where posts will have thousands of comments - all of them positive - because it punishes anyone who comments on content they disagree with. 

For example : I commented on some posts I saw which I thought were disinformation and highly dangerous, vaccine and virus lies that were hand crafted in hostile foreign workshops to get people killed. 

So the algorithm decided I should be inundated w/ the most upsetting horribly wrong and disgusting content from then forward, because ""I interact with that"" or some shit. they want to generate comments, views, and that's all they care about. 

The end result? If I saw more vaccine disinformation on facebook I will have been trained not to respond. To just let it go past. 

and thus only people who AGREE with it and WANT TO SEE MORE of it can comment on things on facebook. 

So you will find something like ""vegetables kill"" w/ like 50,000 comments all supporting it and saying yes , vegetables killed my entire family.

Thing is though, them seeing it isn't great, but them seeing it's absence specifically is just weird and incredibly awkward.

What happens if they go to check out the post in their feed having not refreshed the page? I'd rather it just show it to them in that circumstance as them clicking on it and it having some kind of 'post deleted' or just having some kind of very conspicuous absence would be much worse.

Right after that i emailed Facebook Disabled Service at [disabled@fb.com](mailto:disabled@fb.com). It's been days and I haven't receive a reply from them. So I looked for a so-called ""Facebook service"". These people claims to help you boost your followers, your reach and unlocking accounts with fee and they are very popular in Vietnam. I don't know if your country have that or not. I skimmed through some people who said I'll do it for VN? 1m(about $50)-very high and we couldn't afford it. Later I came across a guy, the name is ""Thanh Son"" if I spelled correct, who said he will do it with ""the price of a cup of coffee"". Then ok, I reached him and said: ""Can you get the account for me please?"". He said it'd be VN? 100k(about $5), pay later. Then I said ok, then let him do it. 15 mins later he said it's done. I asked him :""Where's my account?"". And he replied: ""Give me another 30 mins so I can ultilize the security level for you"". I waited for another 30 mins and asked him again: ""Where's my account now? Can I access it?"". He sent a screenshot of my girlfriend's account to shown that he's gained access. And he charged me another $5 for doing that. After he sent me the login information I tried to login again, this time it works...until it requires me to enter ""Two-Factor Authentication"" code. I asked him what the hell is this, and he said I forgot to remove it. . I told him to remove it, and he said: ""Give me another $5"". At this point i was very suspicious about that so i told him to contact my girlfriend(i created another account for her with high security level and told her to change her password right after that) and said: ""You should work with her"". Then he said ok. After that he told me she didn't have any cash left in her bank account, and she's in a lockdown so she couldn't go to the bank to put the money in. So I give him another $5 to get the code. After that he was silent for 15mins and texted me: Another $5 please (Note that i got $23 remains at first, and that's what I got). WTF? Why does he charge me so much for doing a simple thing? I asked him WHY DO YOU NEED SO MUCH MONEY? He still said: ""Account problems"". Then he insists me to give him $5 or I lost the account. At this point i have almost no more cash left in my bank account, so ",Facebook

Think about this- Facebook started as a prank project by a dork from his college dorm room to rate college campus girls based on their looks and sexiness or how slutty is a girl was ? As it was easy to get this website the attention he was seeking, he found people who would fund him to make this idea mainstream- Then you got the Facebook what it is now.
  
By 2021- Zuckerberg, fooled people all over the world by using their data and manipulating people?s physiology and created a massive antisocial social media dystopia in which billions of people are engaged in unmeaningful  social engagements based on topics amplified by an AI engine that is tuned to generate clicks and multiply an implicit bias and create antisocial geopolitical unrest, sex trafficking, self image shaming and personal physiological discontent.
  
So do you really want to belive in this DORK- that he is on a mission to connect people for the good of human kind- Does he know the meaning of ?meaningful social connections?, which FB often uses to state in their mission.

I have a question that I am finding conflicting answers to and I'm just hoping for some clarification.

If I send a message to someone who is not in my contacts, it should be a ""sent"" icon (tick in a hollow circle). 
Does it change if they ignore? If a couple of days it changes to a delivered icon (tick in a filled circle) does this mean they accepted/ignored/none of the above?

I was hacked last Sunday where the hacker changed e-mail, password and added a 2FA.

Unfortunately I got the message ""you cannot use this function right now"" ""blocked because of spam etc"". So what I did was that I assumed that it was some kind of blocked timer thing on my account. And I was correct, 1 week after I got hacked, I was able to use the change password function. Bypassing the code-authenticator was basically sending my ID again, getting a reset account link and then being able to identify myself by going through a system where I had to identify which one of my friends was in different pictures.

After that, I removed the hackers e-mail, added my own phone number and gained full access to my account again.

"Agreed, Facebook customer service is trash if it even exists and they don't do much when we get hacked, other than tell us to change our passwords. I've been trying to get ahold of some kind of Facebook customer service for about two weeks. I posted something and it got flagged and I got a 30-day ban, but I disputed it. I was notified that they made a mistake, but I'm still blocked. I tried using the help center and the support inbox, but nothing was able to help me. I tried looking up a customer service number on Facebook and I called one and they said something about a technician helping me for $80. I tried messaging Zuckerberg himself and his wife to prove that I'm no longer supposed to be in jail. I even tried going to the Oversight Board, but they required a reference number that doesn't exist where they said it was. Tbh Facebook is getting ridiculous with what they allow and what they don't anyway. Apparently racist threats and hacking your info is fine, but heaven forbid I post a picture of a woman in fishnets and a leotard making out with Ghostface. That's what's really inappropriate.",Facebook

Ideally I'd like to not unfriend her or block her because it *could* create some drama for me if someone noticed. I know that sounds stupid but I'm in college so it is what it is.",Facebook
"So I?m trying to get back my old deactivated account which FB told me I could reactivate just by logging in. I?ve also logged into it in the past to retrieve old childhood pics and kept it dormant again to rejoin in the future so this has worked in the past. Tried logging in again last month and it asked me to confirm identity through trusted contacts (which FB chose randomly for me since my account was deactivated). Somehow got in touch with 3 of those contacts after years and turns out the recovery link doesn?t work for them (?sorry, this content isn?t available at the moment?) because it?s a deactivated account that needs to be logged into to be activated in the first place. Tried ?confirm identity in another way? at the bottom, takes me back to the same old option. Tried submitting ID through one of their help forms, doesn?t let me do so and asks me to login and follow instructions instead (as if I didn?t already know that). Submitted all the other help forms, whichever were possibly applicable to my situation, didn?t hear back from FB.
Read a few threads here about going the Oculus way and finally gave in and bought it (also partly cause I think it was cool too). Got in touch with the live chat support, they basically sent me links to all the above which I?ve already tried and failed at. The thing is the help forms and Help Centre links work for an active account but not for an account that you?re trying to reactivate.
Shared all the screenshots of the troubles I?m facing. Finally they said they will email me and have asked me to provide them with all info related to my FB account such as username, email id associated with the account and alternate email address.
Has anyone had any luck with this recently? I just want all my 10 yrs worth of memories back.

EDIT: 6 days after contacting Oculus I?ve finally got back into my account! This really works! After sending FB screenshots of the problem and my ID, Oculus emailed me on Day 4 saying they?re closing the ticket because it was resolved to which I said I haven?t heard back from FB after providing my ID, and they said they would follow up. Day 6 I finally receive a reset password link on my alternate email ID from FB which takes me straight back to my account! So happy I got all my memories back and Oculus is freaking awesome too! 

Hope this helps some of you out there trying to get your account back, good luck!",Facebook

"Give up on Facebook. The government has made it so that the platform is being heavily sensored and people are losing their accounts because of it. They have an algorithm that just starts randomly picking accounts that post regularly and scrutinizing the hell out of them looking for key words that it thinks incites violence, hatred, or inequality.",Facebook
"I actually don't believe Facebook is responsible for the content posted by it's users.  People would realize this fairly quickly if Facebook were a decentralized platform since they'd have nobody to roast except the poster of said content and in cases of violent content and such the court of public opinion would rule whether something is removed.  All they're doing is promoting the content that gets the most reacts, comments, and views and to design the system any other way doesn't really make sense.  It is not their fault that the content which gets the most engagement is often that which causes anger.  What level of censorship of your feed do you really want though?  Personally I'd like zero censorship.  Perhaps the best answer to this issue is to use their AI to identify ""negative"" content and allowing people the option to hide it if they wish, we can call it ""Head in sand mode"".  As far as this whistleblower goes I am far more concerned that this move may be motivated by stock market manipulation than I am about any of the issues shes raised, I think that might be something worth investigating further.",Facebook

That is what is happening to the servers right now as a literal billion people who could not access the site are all attempting to do so now.  This is the reason most of you will still have problems with Facebook... now, on with the original post...

It appears that Facebook is coming back online.  The DNS servers are resolving now.  Despite this fact, we are currently going to keep the sub restricted for a while.  When I woke up (late) and checked the [sub was overrun](https://media.giphy.com/media/BfiL8ZJWqfw7C/giphy-downsized-large.gif) with pretty much the same posts over and over again.  It was so bad that even [the reddit AI knew something was wrong](https://i.imgur.com/HjTXA6I.png).

~~We are going to give it a little bit of time before we bring the sub off restrictions.  Unfortunately, hundreds of users do not bother to check what is on the sub before posting anything.~~

KEEP IN MIND that with this being one of the largest downtimes for Facebook, that the amount of people attempting to get back is going to cause congestion.  This means you may still experience some intermittent problems while attempting to access Facebook services.

Also, also, for those of you who use Facebook for login to other services (gaming, music, porn, etc) some of those services are going to experience a similar issue.  So you may notice some of those services will be longer to load, problems still getting on, etc.

"This just happened to me. I wake up one morning to find out my password has been changed, email and phone number deleted from my account and was replaced by an unknown email at 4am. I tried to gain access over the next few day only to hit a road block on every attempt. It ended up taking a week to get back in by doing the following steps:
? find my account and hit forgot my password
? follow the steps of being hacked and wait for them to send me a confirmation email
?change my password
?follow the steps to submit my ID for a second time and wait once again to verify
 
After all those steps they sent me a link to log in and once again change my password again. There I went in security and removed the hackers email address and I regain access to my account. Most importantly make sure you do these steps on a computer instead of your phone cause you will not see all the options you need to utilize.

We last chatted on Facebook almost 10 years ago, but have not been Facebook friends since. I messaged him recently, and the message would have gone into message requests, that much I am aware of. The message was delivered (and I presume read, although it didn?t say as we have a bit of a rocky history and I don?t think he would have accepted the message request). Prior to this, up until this morning, I was able to see the options for searching in chat, mute, etc. But now those options are missing. Is it possible that he blocked me in Messenger, but not on Facebook? Or is it a glitch? It isn?t the same on anyone else, just him.",Facebook
"I am in the exact same boat. I woke up Saturday morning to see my Facebook password had been changed, and i immediately went and looked and sure enough... contact email was changed, 2fa was turned on, and i can not get back into the account because of 2fa. 

&#x200B;

i was able to change the email, and password on the account, but now when i try to log in, it asks me for the 2fa code... which i never set up, and do not have access to. 

&#x200B;

i did do a thing with trusted contacts, where i contacted 3 Facebook contacts and they each gave me a code, which worked... but then Facebook said i had to wait 24hrs before logging in. so i waited, and when i went to log in the next day- the email i got said the link had expired. and I'm still stuck in this 2fa loop.",Facebook
"My account has been locked for nearly two days. I was able to get back into my account within two hours of the hacker accessing my account and immediately set up a 2FA with an authenticator app, but my account was locked soon after. When I try to submit my ID, I get the error ""Something went wrong. Please try again later."" Has anybody else got this error?

I am able to log in to my account, both of the emails associated with the account are mine, and my number is on the account. As it appears, the hacker has zero access to my account now, it's all on Facebook.",Facebook
"Keep going to the fb help and send your picture ID
 I had it rejected several times. I waited a day after sending it a few times a day for a few days. Finally an email said click this link to recover your account.
DON'T CLICK ON THAT LINK. COPY AND PAST IT IN ADDRESS BAR. then you will see how to continue. It asked me if I wanted to keep both emails on the account. I deleted the hackers but I should have kept it a d send it to fb. 
Anyway set your own 2fa",Facebook
"I hope it?s okay that I am going a lil OT. I am one of the people who thought all of the internet was down last night because nothing was working. For me, it wasn?t just FB - no internet was working for me (I had 3G on my phone but nothing would load and my internet wouldn?t work). On my computer, it said that I was connected to the network but ?no internet?. Fine, except my boyfriends internet connected just fine. 

Then I went to university, and neither my phone nor my computer would connect to wifi (same issue - connected but ?no internet? while everyone else around me had zero issues). Any ideas what I could do to trouble shoot?",Facebook
"I wish I could insert that Morgan Freeman meme here.  You know the one.  The one where's he's pointing upward and saying ""He's right, you know"".  OP, you did nothing wrong.  Of course FB users' opinions don't matter unless they don't align with those of Facebook.    I feel for you, though.  I got banned from doing certain things on FB for 30 days because of a meme that came up in my memories from a year ago that I didn't even repost this year.  Smh.",Facebook
"Seeing notifications too. :(  
I've got similar problem maybe somebody would know how to deal with it. I cannot log onto Facebook, my account got unlocked thanks to the ID I provided, but now I have to go through the Security Check. I've got two phone numbers linked to account, to one of them I've got access. After log in I got a page saying ""to confirm your identity, we will text a confirmation code to your phone"", there I can choose which phone I wanna use and then click Send Login Code. Here problem begins. After clicking to button, nothing happens with the page it won't go further to a place where I could enter the code (btw I received code on my phone). Tried via Facebook App, Google Chrome, Opera, even Chrome incognito. Just can't reach the step where I could type the code in. Any ideas?",Facebook
"Nah, man, you're fucked. Anything linked to that account is gone. I'm pretty sure your Instagram should be gone too, if you have one, but not sure. But anything on Facebook linked to that account is gone.",Facebook
"They might be having congestion issues or something. I?d suggest waiting a while and trying again. 

A friend of mine found an email to try (for my problem, which they still could t help with. -\__-;;;;). I don?t think there?s any live-chat help center, annoyingly enough.",Facebook
"Finally unlocked my account!! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

By the way- for those who already reset their password or know it, and have access to their email, you can skip to step 5 right away. No need to keep adding emails unless you no longer have access to them.",Facebook
I think it?s how that new regime works because I apparently sent something inappropriate through messenger a few days ago but it wouldn?t tell me what I had sent so I had a 3 day ban?.couldn?t use Facebook or messenger during that time and I know I had done nothing wrong because I use messenger for my fianc‚e when I?m at home and for family I think they?re monitoring stuff more than they let on that?s why they stopped showing proof,Facebook

"Can confirm this. Has it been since you updated to iOS 15? I ask bc I?ve been on iOS 15 since the first beta earlier this summer, and I didn?t have this issue until just a few days ago when the official release came out. I?m guessing something in that update messed things up. It?s annoying as fuck tho",Facebook
She is angry because she was fired. Even water can be harmful if you take it more than the lethal dose. My point is everything has pros and cons. It's your responsibility to do the right thing. Facebook is useful in many ways than the side effects it has using it.,Facebook
"Facebook randomly logged me out for no reason, when I tried logging back in I couldn't remember my password, so I took the steps to change it. I changed my password and tryied logging in again and it asked for a 6 digit code that you supposedly get from inside the Facebook app, from a code generator.  I can't log in without the 6 digit code, but the only way to get this 6 digit code is from inside the app!! It makes no sense. I don't have a phone number associated with my account. Has anyone actually had success using Facebook code generator and how did you do it?",Facebook
"Update: Issue resolved. One of the admins had their FB hacked while they were on vacation, and that account had been set as the page owner (read the page activity log, y'all!), which meant lowly page admins like myself couldn't get in to fix anything. Now it's just a matter of hiding, deactivating, and deleting everything to do with the shop.",Facebook
"unreal. so get this. I finally got a recovery email, gave me a link to open, created a new password, got in, looked thru my mail. logged out to go back to my other profile that I had from years ago, that I was using until this nightmare was over, go to log back in and they are asking me for the 6 digit code that they NEVER SEND...again... so locked out again, its been about a month, let's see how long it takes to get back in. I just want to delete my biz page so no one can access my $ that is linked to that account.. unreal... so sorry for everyone going thru this. it's like you lose a piece of your sanity and all of my identity is out there for someone else to decide if I'm able to socialize online. its gross!",Facebook
